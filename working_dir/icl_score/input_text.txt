Guidance Reminder: On Abortion Procedures, Terminology & Rights

As we've covered the new abortion law in Georgia and legislation in Alabama, we've followed long-standing guidance very well. Thank you to all involved.

For those new to the subject, that guidance about abortion and related topics is collected in our Intranet "radio" style guide. We'll attach it below.

One thing to keep in mind about this law and others like it: Proponents refer to it as a "fetal heartbeat" law. That is their term. It needs to be attributed to them if used and put in quotation marks if printed. We should not simply say the laws are about when a "fetal heartbeat" is detected. As we've reported, heartbeat activity can be detected "about six weeks into a pregnancy." That's at least a few weeks before an embryo is a fetus.

Here is the long-standing guidance:

ABORTION PROCEDURES & TERMINOLOGY: Use the term intact dilation and extraction to describe the procedure, or a procedure known medically as intact dilation and extraction; opponents call it partial-birth abortion. On the latter, it is necessary to point out that the term partial-birth is used by those opposed to the procedure; simply using the phrase so-called partial birth abortion is not sufficient without explaining who's calling it that. Partial-birth is not a medical term and has no exact parallel in medical terminology; intact dilation and extraction is the closest description. Also, it is not correct to call these procedures RARE — it is not known how often they are performed. Nor is it accurate to use the phrase LATE TERM ABORTION. Though we initially believed this term carried less ideological baggage when compared with partial-birth, it still conveys the sense that the fetus is viable when the abortion is performed. It gives the impression that the abortion takes place in the 8th or 9th month. In fact, the procedure called intact dilation and extraction is performed most often in the 5th or 6th month — the second trimester — and the second trimester is not considered "late" pregnancy. Thus "late term" is not appropriate. As an alternative, call it a certain procedure performed after the first trimester of pregnancy and, subsequently, the procedure.... Also note:

NPR doesn't use the term "abortion clinics." We say instead, "medical or health clinics that perform abortions." The point is to not to use abortion before the word clinic. The clinics perform other procedures and not just abortions.

Do not refer to murdered Dr George Tiller as an "Abortion Doctor." Instead we should say Tiller operated a clinic where abortions are performed. We can also make reference to the fact that Tiller was a doctor who performed late abortions.

Here's some additional guidance from Joe Neel, regarding the Unborn Victims of Violence Act:

The term "unborn" implies that there is a baby inside a pregnant woman, not a fetus. Babies are not babies until they are born. They're fetuses. Incorrectly calling a fetus a "baby" or "the unborn" is part of the strategy used by antiabortion groups to shift language/legality/public opinion. Use "unborn" only when referring to the title of the bill (and after President Bush signs it, the Unborn Victims of Violence Law). Or qualify the use of "unborn" by saying "what anti-abortion groups call the 'unborn' victims of violence." The most neutral language to refer to the death of a fetus during a crime is "fetal homicide."

ABORTION RIGHTS:

On the air, we should use "abortion rights supporter(s)/advocate(s)" and "abortion rights opponent(s)" or derivations thereof (for example: "advocates of abortion rights"). It is acceptable to use the phrase "anti-abortion rights," but do not use the term "pro-abortion rights". Digital News will continue to use the AP style book for online content, which mirrors the revised NPR policy. Do not use "pro-life" and "pro-choice" in copy except when used in the name of a group. Of course, when the terms are used in an actuality they should remain.<|endoftext|>抱歉，我們並不支援你正使用的瀏覽器。 為達至最佳瀏覽效果，請更新至最新的瀏覽器版本。 如有問題，歡迎電郵至 pccwmediaiapps@pccw.com 查詢。

【Now新聞台】距離英國脫歐限期不足一個月，英國首相約翰遜終於拋出他的脫歐方案。為了不在愛爾蘭和北愛爾蘭之間出現「硬邊界」，新建議卻令北愛爾蘭變相出現兩個邊界。

捨棄前任文翠珊的保險方案，取而代之的是北愛爾蘭會跟英國其他地方同時離開歐洲關稅同盟，但在農業、食品和工業製品上繼續留在歐洲單一市場，遵守歐盟法規。

那意味北愛爾蘭和愛爾蘭之間在關稅問題上將出現邊界，北愛爾蘭和大不列顛島之間則在單一市場上出現邊界。愛爾蘭島劃分兩個不同關稅區始終需要某種形式上的海關檢查管制程序，如果不想看到實體邊檢設施該如何處理？

約翰遜建議推行電子報關，設立「可信賴貿易商計劃」簡化甚至豁免報關手續，實體檢查也不會在邊境進行，可能在生產場所或供應鏈其中一個點例如貨倉，或愛爾蘭和北愛爾蘭任何地方的「其他指定地點」。

但在現實世界中，電子科技仍未能完全取代邊境實體檢查，所謂在「其他指定地點」檢查，實際上等同海關設施，即使設在距離邊境遠點的地方，也違反英國和愛爾蘭同意，不會因脫歐在愛爾蘭島上衍生任何實體檢查設施的協議。

由於英國其他方不屬歐洲單一市場，運往北愛爾蘭的貨物需要檢查確保符合歐盟法規，意味北愛爾蘭跟大不列顛島之間的愛爾蘭海將出現一條海上邊界，這樣又會引起將北愛從英國分裂出去的爭議，文翠珊曾說沒有一位英國首相可以接受。

約翰遜堅決反對保險方案原因是怕英國無了期留在關稅同盟，貿易無法自主，但他的新方案北愛爾蘭是否繼續留在歐洲單一市場，「四年一檢」由北愛爾蘭議會決定，意味同樣可以無限期延續。<|endoftext|>The use of multiple antennas at a transmitter and/or a receiver of a node in a wireless communication system may significantly boost the capacity and coverage of the wireless communication system. Such Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems exploit the spatial dimension of the communication channel to improve performance by for example transmitting several parallel information carrying signals, so-called spatial multiplexing. By adapting the transmission to the current channel conditions, significant additional gains may be achieved. One form of adaptation is to dynamically, from one Transmission Time Interval (TTI) to another, adjust the number of simultaneously transmitted information carrying signals to what the channel may support. This is commonly referred to as transmission rank adaptation. Precoding is another related form of adaptation where the phases and amplitudes of the aforementioned signals are adjusted to better fit the current channel properties. Classical beam-forming is a special case of precoding in which the phase of an information-carrying signal is adjusted on each transmit antenna so that all the transmitted signals add constructively at the receiver.
The signals form a vector-valued signal and the adjustment may be thought of as multiplication by a precoder matrix. The precoder matrix is chosen based on information about the channel properties. A common approach is to select the precoder matrix from a finite and countable set, a so-called codebook. Such codebook based precoding is an integral part of the Long Term Evolution LTE standard and will be supported in MIMO for High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) in Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) as well. The receiver (e.g. User Equipment, UE) would then typically evaluate all the different precoder matrices in the codebook and signal to the transmitter (e.g. Node B) which element is preferred. The transmitter would then use the signalled information, when deciding which precoder matrix to apply. Since codebook indices need to be signalled and the receiver needs to select a suitable codebook element, it is important to keep the codebook size as small as possible. On the other hand, larger codebooks ensure that it is possible to find an entry that matches the current channel conditions more closely.
Codebook based precoding may be seen as a form of channel quantization. Alternatively, methods may be used that compute the precoder matrix without resorting to quantization.
The fundamental goal of precoder codebook design is to keep the codebook size small while still achieving as high performance as possible. Design of the elements in the codebook thus becomes crucial in order to achieve the intended performance.
Different antenna array configurations influence how the codebook elements should be designed. Many existing solutions are designed with spatially uncorrelated channel fading in mind and where each channel coefficient fades with the same average power. However, such a channel model is not sufficiently accurate when cross-polarized antenna arrays are used. Consequently, the existing designs are ill-suited for such a configuration—an antenna configuration which is deemed important in practice.
To understand why existing designs tailored for equal powered channel coefficients are not efficient for a cross-polarized antenna array setup, consider for simplicity a 2x2 MIMO system in which both the transmitter and the receiver use cross-polarized arrays and the two orthogonal polarizations are aligned on the transmit and receive side, e.g. a pair of vertically and horizontally polarized antennas on both sides of the link. The MIMO channel matrix will then be diagonally heavy, meaning that the on-diagonal elements on average have substantially more power than the off-diagonal ones, since the vertical and horizontal polarizations are on average fairly well-separated even after experiencing the radio channel and reaching the receiver. For such a channel, an appropriate codebook of minimal size contains the unit vectors and the identity matrix. This ensures that when one-stream transmission (rank-one transmission) is performed, all the transmit power may be allocated to the antenna with the strong channel and no power is wasted on the other antenna, which on average will not be able to convey significant power to the receiver. The reason for the latter is because of the cross-polarized setup in conjunction with the selection of rank-one transmission, which means the channel matrix will typically have only one element with a power substantially larger than zero and that element will lie on the diagonal.
All power should hence be allocated to the antenna which corresponds to the aforementioned non-zero diagonal element. For a design which targets a scenario with equal powered channel coefficients, this is however typically not the case. Existing codebook designs do however not address this issue for the case of more than two antennas and also do not consider the structure of the codebook for various transmission ranks.<|endoftext|>Prior Art
The following patents are representative and illustrate the development of the prior art in the field of insoles.
U.S. Pat. No. 2,139,971 to Pava shows an arch support of sponge rubber which is curved to the shape of the foot and has radially spaced ridges under its central region.
U.S. Pat. No. 3,757,774 discloses a novel sandal which is claimed to improve the health of the body and feet having projections provided on the upper and lower surface to stimulate the sole of the foot to facilitate circulation during walking.
Other later patents show massaging insoles. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,047,310 shows a podiatric device molded to the contour of the planar surface of the foot having a plurality of uniformly distributed rigid studs extending upwardly.
U.S. Pat. No. 4,033,054 shows footwear having pressure projections which are positioned to pressure or stimulate effective spots of the foot. The pressure projections each have a magnet for applying a magnetic field to the areas.
A number of patents relating to footwear and specifically massaging type insoles, position massaging cushions or protuberances in areas corresponding to the reflex zones of the foot. U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,831 discloses footwear with an inner sole having upwardly projecting support platforms with foot stimulating dome-shaped bumps on areas not occupied by the platforms. The patentee claims an accupressure application occurs when walking that is capable of effectively massaging the soles of the feet to stimulate appropriate meridians to enhance and normalize circulation.
U.S. Pat. No. 4,760,655 shows an insole having on its upper surface in the region of the foot's reflex zones, flat and somewhat lenticular resilient massaging cushions made of latex rubber which correspond in contour and extent to the respective reflex zone to be stimulated.
U.S. Pat. No. 4,841,647 issued to Sandor Turucz shows shoe insoles having convex protuberances extending from the base of the insoles for providing a rhythmic pressure and massaging action on the soles of the feet during walking. The base is a resilient or spongy material and the protuberances are somewhat more firm so that during walking the protuberances will sink into the base and extend from the base on the lifting portion of the walking gait. The protuberances have geometric forms and are disposed on the base so as to massage certain zones of the soles of the wearer's feet to simulate an accupressure massage. The present invention particularly represents an improvement to the Turucz-type insole.
Thus, while insoles designed to apply massaging in accordance with the ancient technique of reflexology are well known, there nevertheless exists a need for an improved insole of the type which will provide the massage in accordance with reflexology or accupressure techniques if desired by the user and may also be used as a conventional cushioning insole providing good air circulation.
Reflexology or accupressure is an ancient technique involving massaging of strategic points on the soles of the feet. An essential or underlying principle of reflexology is that various organs or muscles of the body are connected by a network of nerves to certain spots or zones on the sole of the feet. Massage applied to these spots or areas promotes circulation of blood flow to the target organ. Additionally, it is theorized that there are channels of energy flowing through the body and that this energy terminates at these strategic spots in the feet.
Accordingly, it is believed that massaging these various strategic zones of the foot results in a revitalization of energy of the person and reflex theory suggests that massaging action unobstructs the flow of energy through these energy channels or passageways. Whether or not one accepts reflexology theory, it is known that massage applied to specific locations of the feet does result in relaxation of the body and that cushioning insoles placed in footwear will reduce fatigue, increase comfort and give the wearer greater endurance.<|endoftext|>Now Commenting On:

Citing lineup limitations, Girardi hits pitcher eighth

Yankees reliever David Phelps recently had a night to remember, striking out nine batters in four innings in a victory over Toronto

By Jack Etkin and Adam Berry
/
MLB.com |

DENVER -- Pitcher David Phelps batted eighth and catcher Austin Romine ninth Wednesday as manager Joe Girardi, who has had to write out some unusual lineups due to a slew of injuries, took a more radical approach.

The Rockies have two left-handed relievers -- Josh Outman and Rex Brothers. With the exception of backup catcher Chris Stewart, Girardi's bench Wednesday had one available right-handed hitter in Ben Francisco, plus Brennan Bosch and Travis Hafner, who bat left-handed.

At the top of his lineup, Girardi had Brett Gardner and Robbie Cano, both left-handed hitters. So if Girardi were to bat Bosch or Hafner for his pitcher, he would have three successive left-handed batters, making it easier for Rockies manager Walt Weiss to match up with Outman or Brothers.

"It's not like I'm trying to re-invent the game," Girardi said. "It's not like I'm trying to make something up. I'm trying to maximize our pinch-hitters and the people we have in our lineup. That's the bottom line. So how do you do that? If you had right-handed bats you could put in between the lefties, you don't worry about it as much. We don't have that. So you're trying to get the hitters that have had the most success off of right-handers up the most and you're also trying to make it more complicated for the other manager to navigate through your lineup."

"And sometimes you may have to do some things that maybe are a little unorthodox, but you got to do it." Girardi added, explaining that the decision was not directed at Romine, who had three hitless at-bats in two games before Wednesday.

According to Elias Sports Bureau, the last time a Yankees starting pitcher batted eighth was Don Larsen on Aug. 28, 1957. The last American League starter to bat eighth was the Royals' Zack Greinke, on June 23, 2009.

Girardi said in the past that while broadcasting, he spoke about hitting the pitcher eighth with Tony La Russa, who employed the tactic often while managing the Cardinals as a way to have No. 3 hitter Albert Pujols bat with as many men on base as possible.

"And I'm trying to put more hitters in a sense in front of Robbie Cano, but also get him as many at-bats as possible," Girardi said.

The Yankees have 10 players on the disabled list, including Kevin Youkilis, Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez, who are rehabilitating at their spring training complex in Tampa, and Curtis Granderson, who finished a stint there and was scheduled to travel from Tampa to Triple-A Scranton on Thursday.<|endoftext|>The parents of missing American journalist Austin Tice made a heart-wrenching appeal for his safe return Thursday in an open letter addressed to his captors in Syria.

“We urge you, whoever you are: let Austin come home for Christmas,” Marc and Debra Tice wrote in the letter, published by McClatchy Newspapers and The Washington Post. “Let us hug him, laugh and cry with him, love him in person. Let us be a whole family again.”

Austin Tice was reporting on Syria’s civil war when he disappeared Aug. 13 near the Damascus suburb of Darayya. The 31-year-old freelance journalist from Houston reported from the front lines of the conflict for McClatchy, The Post and other news outlets. He is a Marine Corps veteran and a student at Georgetown University Law Center.

State Department officials say they believe Tice is in the custody of the Syrian government, but the regime has denied any involvement or knowledge of his whereabouts.

In their letter, the Tices said their eldest son’s 18-week absence has been agonizing for their close-knit family, especially for his six younger siblings.

Thanksgiving dinner without him was unbearable, they wrote.

“Now, as we prepare for the joyful celebration of Christmas, we desperately want our family to be whole,” the Tices wrote. “Our hearts are heavy to think his chair may once again be empty at our family table; we dread missing his great storytelling and contagious laugh.”

The couple said they encouraged their children “to learn about and understand other cultures,” a value Tice took to heart in his globetrotting career.

“Austin has traveled widely, always eager to meet and engage the local people,” they said. “He has a special affinity for the people of the Middle East – he is especially attracted to your tradition of hospitality. He deeply connects with your intense loyalty to family, faith and ideals.”

The Tices described their son as “a passionate and serious man” who went to Syria to witness the truth and share the stories of its people with the world.

He has a soft spot for children and tried to capture in his photographs how events in Syria affected the country’s youngest citizens, they said.

“Austin is just one of the many journalists taking great risks to further knowledge and understanding of other people, places, and events,” his parents wrote. “There is a global consensus through treaty and convention that the work of journalists is essential and should be protected and respected.”

The State Department is working with Czech diplomats in Syria to get information on Tice’s location and welfare, State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said in a statement Thursday. The Czech Embassy in Damascus represents America as a “protecting power” in Syria because the U.S. Embassy has been closed since February.

“The Syrian government has informed us that Austin Tice is not currently in Syria or in Syrian custody,” Ventrell said. “However, Mr. Tice’s last known whereabouts placed him inside Syria, and we have received other reports indicating that he may be held in custody by Syrian authorities. We call upon the Syrian government to assist our protecting power in locating Mr. Tice and to ensure his welfare and safety.”

A YouTube video posted in September – and promoted on a pro-regime Facebook page – appears to show Tice alive in captivity. In the 47-second clip, masked men chant, “God is great,” as they drag the journalist up a hill and force him to his knees. Blindfolded and distraught, Tice can be heard trying to recite an Islamic prayer. Then he gasps, “Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus,” and the video cuts off.<|endoftext|>[Embelin Reverses the Multi-drug Resistance of K562/D to Daunorubicin Independently of P-gp and MDR1 mRNA].
To investigate the mechanism of reversing drug resistance of K562/D cells to daunorubicin by Embelin and its relationship with P-gp and MDR1 mRNA. MTT assay was used to detect and compare the cell proliferation rate of treating with DNR alone and DNR combined with Embelin. Flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining was used to detect cell apoptosis rate, Western blot was used to detect the expression of XIAP,Caspase-3,BCL-2,BAX and P-gp of K562/D cells after using DNR alone and combining with Embelin. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect XIAP,BCL-2,BAX and MDR1 mRNA. The IC50 of K562 and K562/D cells treated with DNR for 24 h were 2.177 µg/ml and 69.43 µg/ml, respectively. The drug-resistance index was 31.89; The proliferation inhibition rates of K562/D cells treated with Embelin of 3, 10, 30, 100 and 300 µg/ml for 24 h were 2.70%±1.08%, 10.92%±4.89%, 28.13%±2.09%, 36.56%±3.24% and 43.59%±1.16%; The proliferation inhibition rates of K562/D cells treated with DNR of 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 µg/ml combined with 10 µg/ml Embelin for 24 h were 31.92%±3.29%, 49.57%±6.87%, 55.16%±0.78% and 71.94%±3.89%. The IC50 was 2.11 µg/ml respectively. The reverse index was 32.91. The apoptosis rates of K562/D cells treated with 0.1 µg/ml DNR alone or combined with Embelin of 10 µg/ml and 30 µg/ml for 24 h were 12.06%±0.95%, 27.54%±0.59% and 39.59%±1.57%, respectively. The results of Western blot showed that after combination of DNR with Embelin, the expression of Caspase-3 was significantly down-regulated (P<0.05), moreover, the prolifiration inhibition effect of drug combination on cells could be countreacted by Z-VAD-FMK, at the same time the expression of XIAP and BCL-2 protein was significantly down-regulated(P<0.05), the expression of BAX protein was significantly up-regulated(P<0.05), while there was no change of P-gp expression later (P<0.05). The results of RT-PCR showed that after combination of DNR with Embelin, expression of XIAP and BCL-2 mRNA was significantly down-regulated(P<0.05), expression of BAX mRNA was significantly up-regulated(P<0.05), while there was no obvious change of MDR1 mRNA expression(P>0.05). The down-regulation of XIAP contributes to enhance the effect of DNR on K562/D cells, the mechanism of Embelin-reversing the drug-resistence of K562/D cells to DNR does not relate with P-gp and MDR1 mRNA.<|endoftext|>In Hindu Astrology, a great emphasis is laid on Kundali matching before marriage. It is based on the age-old Ashtakuta method to determine the compatibility between two people. As per Hindu customs and traditions, Kundali Matching is one of the principal rituals to follow before solemnizing a marriage. It is basically the process of matching horoscopes birth chart of the bride and the groom and determine whether their stars are in harmony for a successful and happy marriage. And, it depends on many factors including the number of Gunas.

Kundali Matching or Horoscope matching is dependant on three factors: Guna Milan, Navamsa Chart , and if there is any mangal dosha present in the birth chart. Guna Milan is based off of calculating the position of moon in the birth charts of the couple. The eight aspects of Guna Milan are calculated and matched, each signifying a different aspect of the married life of the couple.

The Varna or Jaati aspect finds out which category the boy and the girl belong to. The next category, Vashya portrays the situation of power between the two. The aspect is further divided into 5, namely Nara human , Jalchar sea animal , Chatushpad little animal , Keeta insect , and Vanchar wild animal. This classification calculates the power dynamics of the couple; it determines who will overpower the other in this matrimony.

The third aspect is Tara , which calculates the compatibility as per the Nakshatras present in the birth charts. Yoni aspect comes next, which analyses the intimacy between the couples. The aspect figures out if the boy and girl will share love and passionate feelings or not. This aspect is further classified into 14 animal types, each signifying different outcomes. The fifth Aspect is Graha Maitri , which calculates camaraderie and friendship between the two.

The next is Gana aspect which makes sure that the stars align to match the temperament of the two! Rashi aspect and Nadi aspect are the last two, which deal with the emotional stability and health of the couple respectively.

Former general manager Ted Thompson took care of that when he signed receiver Davante Adams and center Corey Linsley to contract extensions as his last major acts in December.

That left new GM Brian Gutekunst the freedom to be selective about the players he wanted back.

So far, there haven’t been many on that list.

Even with the Packers signing Jimmy Graham, Richard Rodgers still could be brought back, but it would have to be on a low-cost deal. Adam Wesley/USA TODAY

In fact, the only players he has re-signed to date all were exclusive rights free agents. They were receiver Geronimo Allison, quarterback Joe Callahan, receiver Michael Clark, offensive linemen Justin McCray and Adam Pankey, cornerback Herb Waters and safety Jermaine Whitehead.

Gutekunst's big moves came with other teams' free agents, signing tight end Jimmy Graham, defensive end Muhammad Wilkerson and cornerback Tramon Williams.

With that in mind, here’s a breakdown of the Packers' free agents who have left and those who remain unsigned after the first wave of free agency.

Morgan Burnett: The 29-year-old safety was the closest thing to a must-sign among the Packers’ free agents, but the relatively low-cost deal (three-years, $14.35 million with $4.25 guaranteed) suggested Gutekunst didn’t put much value on Burnett. The Packers have some options -- Josh Jones and Kentrell Brice chief among them. Jones is better suited to play near the line of scrimmage, while Brice could be better on the back end.

Joe Thomas: The inside linebacker did not receive a restricted free-agent tender; the lowest would have been $1.9 million, but it carried no risk since it wasn’t guaranteed. Thomas received a $600,000 signing bonus from the Cowboys as part of a two-year, $3.6 million deal. He played only 104 snaps on defense last season, but two years ago was on the field for 820 plays and was the primary dime linebacker.

Jeff Janis: The former seventh-round draft pick’s time to contribute as receiver came and went, but he was perhaps the Packers' most valuable special-teams player. He signed last week with the Browns, whose personnel department is filled with former Packers scouts.

Unsigned

Jahri Evans: Even if Evans plays a 13th season, and there has been no indication about whether he might retire, the Packers are expected to move on. McCray should get the first shot at the right guard spot that Evans played for the first 912 snaps last season until he missed the final two games because of a knee injury.

Richard Rodgers: The Packers filled their need for a No. 1 tight end when they signed Graham, but Rodgers still could be re-signed for depth and a sure-handed possession receiver. But it would have to be a low-cost deal. The Packers still have Lance Kendricks plus a couple of developmental possibilities in Emanuel Byrd and Robert Tonyan.

Ulrick John: A backup offensive tackle signed off Arizona’s practice squad last season, John played just 40 snaps last season. He could be back under a minimum deal to compete for a spot in training camp.

Davon House: The signing of Williams won’t preclude the Packers from bringing back the veteran cornerback for another season. The sides are scheduled to talk this week.

Ahmad Brooks: The Packers took a chance on the veteran outside linebacker but got little in return for their $3.5 million investment -- the same money that Julius Peppers got from Carolina last year after he left Green Bay. Brooks had 1.5 sacks; Peppers had 11. There’s little chance Brooks will return.

Quinton Dial: Like Brooks, Dial was a last-minute pickup right before the regular season started. He provided depth on the defensive line, but with the signing of Wilkerson, it’s not a sure thing that Dial will return.

Brett Goode: The Packers have been trying to get younger at long-snapper for the last few years but keep going back to Goode. The Packers signed Zach Triner, who has never snapped in an NFL game, but they could re-sign Goode to another minimum deal at any time as long as he’s still available.

Taybor Pepper: Another long-snapper, Pepper played in four games last season (while Goode dealt with a hamstring injury) before he broke his foot and finished on IR.<|endoftext|>The high-throughput gene expression profiling technologies facilitate screening expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously. One of the main objectives for analyzing gene expression profiles is to identify genes differentially expressed (DE) in cancer compared with normal control[@b1]. Many methods have been proposed to identify DE genes[@b2][@b3][@b4][@b5] and a popular choice is Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) based on *t*-test statistic[@b6]. It has been reported that the *t*-test is biased to genes with low expression levels[@b3][@b6] because a gene with low expression level may have a large absolute *t*-statistic due to its small variance, even when its mean difference between two conditions is small[@b7]. SAM was proposed to correct this bias. However, due to logarithmic transformation of data in SAM, the differences of log-scaled expression levels between two conditions are actually the logarithms of their fold change (FC) ratios. Because genes with low expression levels are more likely to reach large FCs than genes with high expression levels, SAM is also biased to genes with low expression levels[@b8]. Compared with genes expressed at low levels, genes expressed at high levels are more likely to be involved in some functionally conserved pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation[@b9], glutathione metabolism[@b10][@b11][@b12] and proteasome[@b13] with important biological significances.

In a recent study[@b8], we have proposed an algorithm, named the pairwise difference (PD) algorithm, to identify DE genes in small-scale cell line experiments, which typically measure only two or three technical replicates for each of two different experimental conditions, respectively. Briefly, by pairing technical replicates under two conditions, the algorithm identifies DE genes with top-ranked absolute expression differences between the two types of cells which are significantly reproducible in independent paired technical replicates[@b8]. Compared with SAM and other commonly used methods, PD can exclusively identify many DE genes with high expression levels in both two types of cells[@b8]. However, this algorithm cannot be used directly to identify DE genes between two types of tissue samples (e.g., cancer and normal control) because the biological replicates of each type of tissue may have large between-individual differences.

In this study, in consideration that tissue samples are biological replicates with between-individual differences, we averaged the gene expression profiles separately for two types of samples in a dataset to construct a cancer-normal pair, and then applied PD to identify DE genes using multiple cancer-normal pairs separately constructed from several independent datasets or sub-datasets of a dataset. Using datasets for lung cancer and esophagus cancer, we demonstrated the applicability and power of this strategy in finding functionally important DE genes highly expressed in both cancer and normal tissues that tend to be missed by SAM.

Results
=======

The applicability of the PD algorithm to multiple datasets
----------------------------------------------------------

Firstly, for each of the three datasets for lung cancer and normal samples (see [Table 1](#t1){ref-type="table"}), we separately averaged the gene expression profiles for cancer and normal samples in each datasets to construct a paired average gene expression profiles, referred to as a cancer-normal pair. Then, for every cancer-normal pair, all genes were ranked according to their absolute average differences (AD) of expression levels between cancer and normal samples in descending order. As shown in [Fig. 1a](#f1){ref-type="fig"}, the consistency scores of the deregulation directions of the top *n (n* = 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000) genes between every two cancer-normal pairs were all higher than 91.8%, which were all significantly higher than what expected by chance (binomial test, all *p* \< 2.2 × 10^−16^) (see *Methods* for details). We did similar analyses in two datasets for esophagus cancer ([Table 1](#t1){ref-type="table"}) and found that the consistency scores of the deregulation directions of the top *n (n* = 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000) genes between the two datasets were all higher than 96.42%, as shown in [Fig. 1b](#f1){ref-type="fig"}. These results suggested that the differential expression signals between every two independent cancer-normal pairs for a particular cancer were significantly reproducible.

We further did a random experiment to show that the differential expression signals were irreproducible when there were no phenotype differences between two groups of samples. Using the GSE19804 dataset with 60 lung cancer samples and 60 normal samples, we randomly permuted sample labels two times to produce two datasets of artificial "cancer" and "normal" samples, and then calculated the consistency score of the deregulation directions of the top 1000 genes sorted by the average expressions difference between the two artificial cancer-normal pairs. The random experiment was repeated 1000 times. As expected, the average of the 1000 consistency scores was 49.83% with 0.1954 of standard deviation. These results suggested that the differential expression signals were irreproducible when there were no phenotype differences between two groups of samples.

Then, regarding every cancer-normal pair as an independent pair of technical replicates, we used the PD algorithm to identify reproducible DE genes between the lung cancer and normal control of three datasets. The two parameters of the algorithm, the initial step and the consistency threshold, were set as 300 and 95%, respectively, as suggested previously[@b8]. With the above two parameters, PD identified a list of 6,092 DE genes for lung cancer, and this list of DE genes was denoted as C3. In comparison, 10,865, 12,287 and 10,945 DE genes were identified by SAM with 5% FDR control in the GSE19188, GSE19804 and GSE27262 datasets, respectively. The consistency scores of the overlapped DE genes between C3 and the DE genes identified by SAM in the three datasets were 99.83%, 100% and 100%, respectively ([Table 2](#t2){ref-type="table"}). Similarly, PD identified 3,498 DE genes based on the two datasets of esophagus cancer, denoted as C2, and the consistency scores with DE genes identified by SAM in the two datasets were both 100% ([Table 2](#t2){ref-type="table"}).

On the other hand, approximately 9.3--22.1% of the DE genes in C3 identified by PD were not identified by SAM. As shown in [Fig. 2](#f2){ref-type="fig"}, the average expression levels of the DE genes exclusively identified by PD were rather high in both cancer and normal samples of the three datasets, while the average expression levels of most DE genes exclusively identified by SAM were quite low in cancer and/or normal samples. Similar results were observed based on the two datasets for esophagus cancer ([Supplementary Figure S1](#S1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}). Thus, the PD algorithm can identify DE genes expressed highly in both cancer and normal tissues, which tend to be missed by SAM.

The applicability of the PD algorithm to a single dataset
---------------------------------------------------------

We used the dataset GSE27262 for 25 lung cancer samples and 25 normal samples to exemplify the feasibility of the PD algorithm in analyzing a single dataset. Firstly, we divided this dataset evenly into two sub-datasets according to the GSM series numbers of samples: set 1 and set 2 with 12 and 13 pairs of cancer and normal samples, respectively ([Table 3](#t3){ref-type="table"}). Then, we transformed the two sub-datasets into two independent cancer-normal pairs of averaged gene expression profiles. With the same parameter setting as above, PD identified 3,789 DE genes, denoted as S2. 3,386 of these 3,789 DE genes overlapped with C3 and the consistency score between S2 and C3 was 100%. When dividing the GSE27262 into four small sub-datasets ([Table 3](#t3){ref-type="table"}), PD identified 4,157 DE genes, denoted as S4. The consistency score between S4 and C3 was 99.94%.

Similarly, when dividing the dataset GSE29001 evenly into two and four small sub-datasets, respectively, PD identified 1,738 and 2,298 DE genes for esophagus cancer. The consistency scores between the two lists of DE genes with the DE genes in C2 were 100% and 99.88% ([Table 4](#t4){ref-type="table"}), respectively.

Taking together, the above results demonstrated that PD can work well by dividing a dataset evenly into several sub-datasets with sample sizes as small as about six for each type of samples.

Significant functional pathways detected by the PD algorithm
------------------------------------------------------------

Here, we used the above dataset GSE27262 for lung cancer and the dataset GSE29001 for esophagus cancer to demonstrate that most of the pathways significantly enriched with DE genes found by PD tend to be missed by SAM.

With 10% FDR control, the DE genes in S2 found by PD for lung cancer were significantly enriched in 14 pathways ([Fig. 3a](#f3){ref-type="fig"}). However, none of these pathways was identified as significant by enrichment analysis with the same FDR control for the 10,945 DE genes found by SAM with 5% FDR control. When focusing on the most significant DE genes found by SAM, with the same number of DE genes in S2, 13 of the 14 significant pathways were still unfound ([Fig. 3a](#f3){ref-type="fig"}). Besides, the DNA replication pathway[@b19] commonly found by PD and SAM, the other 13 significant pathways are mainly associated with lung cancer, including pentose phosphate pathway[@b20], oxidative phosphorylation[@b9][@b21], cysteine and methionine metabolism[@b22], glutathione metabolism[@b10][@b11][@b12], biosynthesis of amino acids[@b23], ribosome[@b24], proteasome[@b13], protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum[@b25][@b26], phagosome[@b27] and TNF signaling pathway[@b28]. These conservative pathways included many DE genes highly expressed in both cancer and normal tissues, which tended to be missed by SAM. For example, among the 16 DE genes found exclusively by PD in the TNF signaling pathway, the average expression level of CCL2 was ranked at the top 3.2% and 1% of all the measured genes in the cancer and normal samples, respectively. The difference between the average expression level of this gene in the cancer samples and its average expression level in the normal samples was as large as 1678.72, whereas the average of the corresponding differences for all the DE genes identified by SAM was only 245.03. It has been reported that this gene may play an important role in the development of lung cancer[@b29]. For another example, the average expression level of TNFAIP3 was ranked at the top 7.4% and 3.2% of all the measured genes in the cancer and normal samples, respectively. The difference between the average expression level of this gene in the cancer samples and its average expression level in the normal samples was 625.43. This gene has been reported as a negative regulator of NF-kappa B activation as well as TNF-mediated apoptosis[@b30] and its underexpression can promote the progression of lung cancer[@b31]. The detailed information about these 16 DE genes was shown in [Supplementary Table S1](#S1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}.

Similarly for esophagus cancer, the four pathways significantly enriched with DE genes in S2 identified by PD were all missed by SAM ([Fig. 3b](#f3){ref-type="fig"}). These significant pathways included pathways for oxidative phosphorylation[@b32], glutathione metabolism[@b33], ribosome[@b34][@b35] and proteasome[@b36].

The above pathway enrichment analyses demonstrated that the PD algorithm can capture important cancer-associated pathways with highly expressed DE genes, including many housekeeping genes (see *Discussion*), which might play important roles in oncogenesis, whereas most of these pathways tend to be missed by SAM. The results also provided extra evidence supporting the reliability of the DE genes found by PD because a list of DE genes can be significantly enriched in pathways only when it contains sufficient real DE genes[@b37][@b38].

Discussion
==========

In this paper, we extended the application of the PD algorithm to the identification of DE genes between cancer and normal tissue samples based on several independent datasets or sub-datasets of a dataset. The application results for lung and esophageal cancer showed that PD can exclusively identify many DE genes with high expression levels in both cancer and normal samples, which tend to be missed by the commonly used SAM. Functional enrichment analyses of DE genes identified by PD showed that it can exclusively identify many significant biological pathways related to the development of cancers. Especially, the results demonstrated that the PD algorithm could efficiently identify DE genes by dividing a dataset evenly into several sub-datasets with sample sizes as small as about six for each type of samples. In general, for researchers with their own experimental data, we would recommend them making use of independent datasets in public data sources, in cases that such data exist, in order to increase the power and accuracy of biological discovery.

Notably, in our functional analysis examples for lung cancer and esophagus cancer, four pathways were commonly identified by PD but missed by SAM. These four pathways were well known cancer-related pathways for oxidative phosphorylation, glutathione metabolism, ribosome and proteasome. These biological pathways are related to two important cancer hallmarks, the metabolic network (the oxidative phosphorylation and glutathione metabolism pathways) and genome duplication network (ribosome) according to the cancer hallmarks network framework proposed by Wang *et al*.[@b39]. Reprogramming of metabolism is an important mechanism supporting the growth and division of cancer cell[@b40]. Genome duplication plays an important role on tumor formation and can activate several cancer hallmarks network[@b41][@b42]. These conservative cancer hallmarks or pathways all included many highly expressed housekeeping genes playing essential roles in the pathogenesis of cancer. For example, in the ribosome pathway, among the 45 DE genes found exclusively by PD in the GSE27262 dataset for lung cancer ([Supplementary Table S2](#S1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}), 35 genes were housekeeping genes reported by Zhu *et al*.[@b43]. The average expression levels of these 35 housekeeping genes were all ranked among the top 20% of all the measured genes in both the cancer and normal samples. It is known that housekeeping genes maintain the basic needs for a cell to survive[@b44][@b45][@b46], and thus their deregulations tend to induce human diseases including cancer[@b47][@b48]. For examples, the overexpression of RPSA may be positively correlated with the angiogenesis of lung cancer[@b49][@b50], the overexpression of RPL19 promotes malignant proliferation of lung cancer cells[@b51], and the underexpression of RPS3, a critical regulator of DNA repair and apoptosis[@b52], might accelerate the development of lung cancer. Such cancer-related housekeeping genes tend to be evolutionarily conserved and play critical roles in carcinogenesis together with tissue-specific less-conservative cancer-related genes[@b53].

Although PD can exclusively identify many important cancer-associated genes with high expression levels which play important functional roles in carcinogenesis, it has its own shortcomings. A major limitation is that it still cannot obtain DE genes with FDR control. Obviously, the higher the consistency threshold was set, the lower the rate of false positives of DE genes identified between two independent sample pairs. However, the FDR has a complex relationship with the parameter of consistency threshold. Besides, some DE genes and pathways identified by SAM were missed by PD which is biased to genes with high expressions. For example, DE genes identified by SAM from the dataset GSE27262 for lung cancer were enriched in the fanconi anemia pathway related with risk of lung adenocarcinoma[@b54][@b55]. However, this pathway was missed by DE genes identified by PD. In this pathway, 13 DE genes were identified by SAM but not by PD. The average expression levels of the 13 genes were among the bottom 70% and 61% of all the measured genes of all the cancer and normal samples, respectively. These results demonstrate that, different from SAM, PD tends to miss DE genes with low expression levels. Therefore, the PD algorithm is not a substitution but an effective complement to current approaches for analyzing DE genes of tissue datasets with biological replicates.

Methods
=======

Data and data pre-processing
----------------------------

Multiple gene expression datasets for lung cancer and esophageal cancer were collected from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)[@b56]. Detail information about these datasets used in this study were described in [Table 1](#t1){ref-type="table"}. For each dataset, the raw data (.CEL files) was pre-processed using the robust average (RMA) algorithm[@b57][@b58]. Then each probe-set ID was matched to its Entrez gene ID. If multiple probesets were matched to the same gene, the expression value for the gene was referred to as the arithmetic mean of the values of the multiple probesets (on the log2 scale).

Identification of reproducible DE genes
---------------------------------------

The pairwise difference (PD) algorithm[@b8] was originally designed for analyzing small-scale cell line data with two or three technical replicates for each of two different cell lines. Since technical replicates for a cell line have no biological difference, every two independent pairs of technical replicates for two different cell lines can be regarded as independent experiments to identify DE genes through reproducibility evaluation. However, because tissue samples from different individuals are biological replicates with large biological variations among individuals, every two paired samples for two types of tissues cannot be regarded as reproducible independent experiments. In order to reduce the influence of biological variations among samples with the same phenotype, we used several independent datasets to construct multiple cancer-normal pairs by averaging a set of gene expression profiles separately for each of the two phenotypes. Specifically, for each dataset, we calculated the mean non-log-transformed expression values of each gene in the normal samples (type N) and cancer samples (type C), respectively, to form a paired average gene expression profiles for cancer and normal tissues. For a given pair *j* consisting of one type N sample and one type C sample, the mean values of gene *i* in the type N sample and type C sample, denoted as and , respectively, were calculated as following:

where *n*~1~ and *n*~2~ were the numbers of samples in type N and type C, respectively. *x*~*ik*~ was the expression value of gene *i* in a type N or type C sample.

Then, for gene *i*, the average expression difference between two phenotypes of a given cancer-normal pair *j*, denoted as *D*~*ij*~, was calculated as following:

If the value was larger (or smaller) than zero, then gene *i* was defined as up-regulation (or down-regulation) in type C sample. Regarding multiple cancer-normal pairs constructed from independent datasets as independent experiments, we could identify DE genes through reproducibility evaluation with the same PD algorithm descried in details in our original paper[@b8]. Briefly, all genes in each cancer-normal pair were sorted in descending order by their absolute pairwise expression differences between two phenotypes and divided into blocks by the initial step of 300. The significantly reproducible DE gene lists between the decreasingly ranked blocks of each two independent pairs were identified if their consistency scores were higher than a pre-settled consistency threshold (here, 95%).

Reproducibility evaluation of two DE gene lists
-----------------------------------------------

For two DE gene lists from two different datasets sharing *k* DE genes, of which *s* genes had the consistent directions (either up-regulation or down-regulation) in type C samples, the consistency score was calculated as *s/k*. The cumulative binomial distribution model[@b59] was used to estimate the probability of observing at least *s* of *k* DE genes with the consistent directions by chance:

in which *p*~e~ is the probability of one gene having the consistent direction in two DE gene lists by random chance (here, *p*~e~ = 0.5). A DE genes list is considered significantly reproducible if the *p* value of the consistency score is \<0.01.

Pathway enrichment analysis
---------------------------

Functional enrichment analysis was done based on the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes[@b60]. The hypergeometric distribution model was used to identify biological pathways that were significantly enriched with DE genes[@b61], the probability of observing at least *k* genes in a pathway by chance can be computed as follow:

*n* is the number of DE genes identified from *N* genes in a dataset and *k* of them are annotated in a pathway with *m* genes.

The *p* values were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure[@b62], controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) at the 10% level.

In Ann Arbor, Michigan, stormwater typically drains into a
network of more than 500 stormwater management systems (“county
drains”) that are overseen by a Washtenaw County Drain Commission. These
drains provide stormwater management, flood prevention and stream protection
for urban and rural land in the county.

Ann Arbor, a densely populated university town of 180,000
(during the academic year), has been seeing an increase in urban redevelopment
pressure in recent years as developable land has become scarce and land values
have risen. The city of Ann Arbor has worked closely with the County Drain
Commissioner’s office to use this redevelopment as an opportunity to
improve the quality of stormwater flowing into the county drains.

Late last year, an Ann Arbor developer received a permit to
build a new mini-storage facility on a site that had three exiting buildings.
The site was on a congested four-lane road near the University of Michigan, one
of the major routes into downtown Ann Arbor. According to general contractor
Steven Lucchesi of Steven J. Lucchesi, Inc., the existing buildings on either
side of the site would stay intact, but adding a new building to the site
required that the overall systems serving the site, including water and sewer,
be upgraded. The city’s stormwater ordinances require that stormwater
runoff from any newly created impervious surface be captured and detained on
site, and then treated prior to discharging into the city’s stormwater
system.

“We were adding a 5,000 square foot building, which
meant that there would be about 30,000 square feet of surface area
runoff,” said Lucchesi. “In addition to a retention/detention
system, the city asked us to install a swirl chamber to help clean the water
before pumping it into the exiting sewers.”

The ordinance
requires that the treatment system remove 80% of Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
or more, and that the system’s performance be verified by testing. The
city also required that the system be accessible for maintenance and removal of
trapped pollutants.

The site of the new building was a tight one, only 100 feet
wide between the two existing buildings, and did not allow for a large
excavation to install a stormwater treatment system.

Although another system had originally been specified, these
site constraints caused the project engineer to change the specifications to a
Vortechs System Model 1000, an oil and grit separator that treats a flow rate
of up to 1.6 cfs. Manufactured by Vortechnics, Inc. of Portland, Maine, the
Vortechs System uses a patented vortex process to remove 80 percent or more of
Total Suspended Solids (TSS) including trash, oil, grit and hydrocarbons from
stormwater runoff. The Washtenaw County Drain Commission allows the Vortechs
System as an approved best management practice (BMP) for stormwater treatment,
so the last minute change did not affect permitting or slow down the tight
construction schedule.

To install the Vortechs System, Lucchesi needed to
manipulate his machinery onto the site, excavate a hole, and set the precast
unit in place. Because the system is horizontal in design and has a shallow
profile, it required only a ten-foot deep hole on the site for installation.
Other stormwater treatment systems can require depths of up to 18 feet to
accommodate their vertical configuration.

“A Vortechnics sales engineer showed up the day of the
installation, and really helped solve a few issues before they became
problems,” he said.

“In Ann Arbor, we are installing more and more of
these types of units. The city is requiring them on all new development, even
if the site dumps into open detention areas,” said Lucchesi.

The process took about a day from start to finish, far less
than he had anticipated.<|endoftext|>All political parties bring out manifestos at the time of elections in order to inform prospective voters of their socio-economic vision for the country. The vision is largely influenced by the ideologies of the parties in the fray. Given the fact that the two major national parties, the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have been in the political arena for long or have been governing parties, it is taken for granted that their ideologies are well known, though ideologies are subject to nuanced interpretations and viewpoints of the leaders of the parties.

The economic part of the vision of the two parties does not differ much though nuances exist on the question of “growth first before distribution" (a relatively strident BJP viewpoint) and ineffectiveness of public spending on account of subsidies and special programmes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and food security (again a relatively strident BJP viewpoint). On the private sector’s role, both parties are practically on the same page.

The party that aspires to be a major national party, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had a brief stint of power at Delhi. Its economic vision is not well known, though one could gleam it from some actions of the party in its brief tenure of office at Delhi and from some of the utterances of its leaders, Arvind Kejriwal and Yogendra Yadav. The party’s strategy seems to be veering round new colours of Gandhism and democratic socialism, the two concepts that pervaded the Indian economic scene in the early years after Independence. Its main areas of focus seem to be: power, water supply, primary school education with facilities especially for girl students (three actions that they took during their office stint and are critical in any future economic strategy), communication with the people on a regular basis—the mohallas (transparency and needs-based approach), objection to “crony capitalism" and a strong statement for withdrawal of government from business. This is a kind of Gandhism that seems to suggest that agriculture, manufacturing, and small-scale industries would have to be fostered within the private sector. The party has also opposed foreign direct investment (FDI) in the retail sector. It has announced total rejection of categorization of ideas as “left wing" or “right wing". Further, it wants urgent redressal of people’s short term needs, simple living for all ministers and officials (another streak of Gandhism), strong advocacy for ombudsmen and for hearing citizens’ grievances against corrupt politicians, bureaucrats, criminals and communal groups. The party also wants open and transparent communication about funding of elections (which could include state funding of elections). The only issue on which there has not been much mention is in the area of primary health and healthcare. But one would not be surprised if this too would have been a part of the party action-plan had the party stayed on in power for a little longer time.

Critics, however, point out that public spending will outpace the known revenue resources. This could be true in the very short run but given the limited tenure of office, one may have to carefully sift as soon as possible the party’s fundamental social and public policy for further clues about what the party will have spelled as its stance on these matters. By saying that the state should not be in business, the party seems to hint that publicly owned enterprises would be more speedily privatized and resources generated to take care of the party’s concerns for economic growth and economic equality.

The model of development that emerges from these viewpoints is not something new going by the debates on the development strategies in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and in India in the 1950s. The non-state business regime without regulatory overreaches and with strong anti-corruption mechanisms will enable absorption of relatively abundant labour in agriculture, small-scale industries, manufacturing activities and services sector. The party, however, has to provide an idea of what it thinks should be the incentives for work and conducting economic activities simply because the state will be out of business and business will be conducted by the private sector. This will raise issues related to fiscal and monetary policy and regulatory policies on which the party has to give some indication. It is also important to signal the party’s views on international economic and financial policies. Once Indian business is given such a huge role as the party seems to imply, one would like to believe that it is for large-scale foreign technical and financial cooperation.

Most other parties do not seem to aspire to be national parties in the strict sense of the term since their reach is restricted and their inclination is not to field candidates over the length and breadth of the country.

([@R1]) This prolific problem involves "holding" admitted or pending transfer patients in the emergency department, resulting in loss of precious bed capacity. A 2009 white paper ([@R2]) by the American College of Emergency Physicians noted that 62.5% of emergency departments (and 85% of those with annual visit volumes more than 50,000) reported boarding ED patients for more than 2 hours. A 2012 American Hospital Association survey ([@R3]) revealed that 38% of hospital emergency departments were operating "at" or "over" capacity.

Numerous downstream effects result from the boarding burden, including loss of capacity to treat the queue of patients who predictably arrive in the emergency department, longer cycle times for emergency department patients, decreased bed utilization, suboptimal quality and safety for boarded patients, and poor perception of quality and confidentiality by boarded patients housed in hallways ([@R4]).

Although flow models such as split-flow can significantly reduce cycle times and throughput intervals ([@R5]), they do not displace or lessen the gravity of the boarding problem. To improve service and quality in the emergency department, hospitals must confront the institutional, systemic problem of boarding to free the emergency department of the undue burden of caring for inpatients. An essential means to achieving this is through the development of hospital-wide flow teams that engage inpatient unit leaders, physicians, and executives to promote the use of validated real-time systems, principals, and processes.

TIME MATTERS
============

Efficient disposition is critical for many reasons. ED consumers desire timely care. When ED beds are occupied by patients holding for admission, front-end flow is impacted. Patients then leave without treatment, perhaps the ultimate quality indicator for emergency care. In fact, many patient complaints across the industry are often rooted in excessive wait times to see a provider.

In addition, time-sensitive treatments are dependent on efficient ED throughput. As a result, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) now collects and reports throughput metrics, such as NQF 497 (Admit Decision to ED Departure Time), and has already begun to link throughput performance to reimbursement. (Data collection now will impact 2014 reimbursement.) The current benchmark for best practice is 97 minutes (based upon [hospitalcompare.gov](http://hospitalcompare.gov) benchmarking data between second quarter 2012 to first quarter 2013 ED visits).

The CMS also requires reporting time-sensitive clinical treatments dependent on ED throughput, such as acute myocardial infarction (door to balloon time less than 90 min), acute stroke (time to tissue plasminogen activator less than t3--4 hr), and sepsis: early goal-directed therapy. By connecting improvement efforts to clinical quality to meet best practice standards on these metrics, ED leaders can effectively engage inpatient clinical staff to improve throughput. In addition, physicians and hospitalists are increasingly contractually obligated to meet flow metrics, incentivizing their active partnership in improving throughput in the emergency department.

Facilitating Admissions From the Emergency Department
-----------------------------------------------------

Best practices for facilitating timely admissions from the emergency department include active identification and communication of potential admissions, the use of no-delay nurse reports, and faxed admission reports. However, before requesting assistance from inpatient leaders on back-end flow, it is critical that the emergency department has first addressed front-end and middle flow---those issues that it can address on its own---to ensure credibility with inpatient leaders.

### Identify and Communication Potential Admissions

Once the emergency department has made significant progress with throughput challenges it can impact on its own, it must next focus on proactive communication with inpatient leaders. The ED staff and providers must ensure timely communication to bed management (e.g., patient access, nursing supervisor, director on call) when a decision is made to admit a patient.

It is the emergency department\'s responsibility to ensure that information on the status of admitted ED patients is communicated through the appropriate bed management channels and current in the electronic health record or other bed management systems as applicable. To ensure accurate communication and anticipation of admissions, the ED attending physician and charge nurse should round at least every 4 hr at the ED tracking board to review patients\' status, identify need for admission, and assess ED crowding as well as the need to implement a surge protocol, if applicable.

### Utilizing No-Delay Nurse Reports

No-delay nurse reports reduce time from admit orders to arrival on inpatient units, decrease the potential for handoff errors (because they ensure that both the ED and inpatient nurses have the same information), and increase patients\' perception of care due to timely transfer of care.

A sample process might resemble the following: After the order is written and a request for a bed is made, the ED nurse opens a "transfer of care" report, which is also accessible to the floor nurse. The ED nurse then awaits the patient bed assignment (by monitoring the tracking board). Fifteen minutes after the bed has been assigned, either the unit clerk calls down to the emergency department to accept the patient or the accepting inpatient primary nurse or charge nurse will call to ask questions. In either case, the ED patient is transferred within 15 min of a bed becoming available. No-delay nurse reports are best included in the electronic health record, but a faxed paper report may also be used.

Best Practices for an Effective Hospital-Wide Throughput Committee
------------------------------------------------------------------

Beginning January 1, 2014, The Joint Commission (TJC) revised standards LD.04.03.11 and PC.01.01.01 ([@R7]; which govern patient flow through the emergency department) to include a requirement for goal setting and measurement to mitigate and better manage the boarding of patients. This includes a requirement for individuals to manage patient flow processes to review measurement results to goals and take action to improve patient flow when goals are not achieved.

An effective hospital-wide throughput committee addresses this need by meeting monthly and typically convening 12--15 individuals who can best drive process improvement and remove barriers for admitting patients quickly from the emergency department. It is an interdisciplinary team that typically includes hospitalists, leaders from the emergency department (e.g., director, manager, flow coordinator), and inpatient leaders from critical care, telemetry, and med-surg. "Although we may consider the operational components from the emergency department to inpatient to be a care transition, we must evolve our processes and mindset to one of a team approach to support a patient-centered continuum of care," notes Dan Smith, MD, FACEP, one of StuderGroup\'s medical directors and an expert on ED flow efficiency.

This group may include the environmental services leader, transport leader, admissions leader, administrative supervisor (nursing supervisor), risk manager, and discharge planner/case manager. Attendance by a senior leader sponsor is also important for buy-in and accountability.

The charter of the hospital throughput committee should clearly define its scope and focus. The scope and focus of this committee should promote the creation and monitoring of measurable outcomes that address the above mandates from CMS and TJC. The committee members must not lose sight of the importance to address back-end ED flow as a hospital-wide problem that only this type of interdisciplinary team can correct. The meeting agenda flows from these goals with a review of "wins," priority throughput indicators, clinical quality issues, financial impact from reducing length of stay, and review of the hospital\'s current "throughput dashboard." The purpose of this hospital-wide throughout dashboard is to collect and track current data on key metrics so that the team can identify trends and performance gaps, and when centered around it, teams can ensure that meetings are productive and actionable.

Dashboard data typically include measures such as disposition to admission by unit, disposition to admission by time of day, hospital discharge by time of day, staffing by hour (for ED nursing, environmental services, and hospitalists), and other inpatient admission process times. Process times may include total turnaround time for admitted patients, time of physician order to discharge to patient departure, patient departure to notification of housekeeping, notification of housekeeping to bed clean, bed clean to assignment of new patient to bed, and time of bed assignment to new patient in bed.

The team can also track bed assignment time to report received to ensure that no-delay nurse reports are occurring consistently. To ensure compliance with and tracking of NQF measures as required by CMS, the dashboard should include these metrics as well. Other optional metrics for this dashboard may include environmental service turnaround times, post anesthesia care unit (PACU) hold hours, and ED hold hours/diversion hours (see Figure [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}).

![Sample dashboard of performance metrics for hospital-wide throughput committee. A full-size copy may be downloaded at [www.studergroup.com/samplethroughputdashboard](http://www.studergroup.com/samplethroughputdashboard).](aenj-37-65-g001){#F1}

As each leader reports out on next action steps with dates due, these are captured in the meeting minutes for follow-up. Goals to consider include times for inpatient to discharge, room assigned to occupied, discharge order goals, environmental service turnaround times, PACU hold hours, and ED hold hours.

It is recommended that this committee also assess and evaluate the effectiveness of the surge plan at least every 3 years to ensure that it is producing desired results on the basis of the charter and goals identified by this team. A strong and effective surge plan identifies specific actions for ED, inpatient, administrative, and ancillary leaders through a tiered response. Each of these tiered responses should have specific action items within them for all departments that impact transition of patients out of the ED. Each of these responses should be precisely designed steps to prevent escalation to the next level.

By collaborating closely with inpatient units, the emergency department at UConn Health, an integrated academic medical center in Farmington, Connecticut, has made dramatic gains in ED throughput in just 2 yr. Over 24 months, the team has reduced ED arrival to departure time from 461 to 336 min and ED admit decision to departure time for admitted patients from 225 min to 143 min.

"Having physicians write transition orders has also really reduced bottlenecks. In fact, we\'ve reduced the time from admit decision to transition orders from 102 minutes to 22 minutes in just the last six months by coordinating this process closely through the ED physician, hospitalist and an inpatient resident," explains AnnMarie Capo, associate vice president for clinical effectiveness and patient safety. "Instead of having one medical officer of the day visit patients in the emergency department, transition orders move patients to the inpatient unit quickly where inpatient nurses can more efficiently divide the work and expedite quality patient care." Moving a case manager into the emergency department full-time has also ensured that all stakeholders are together to assign bed placements.

Tactics to Support an Effective Hospital-Wide Throughput Committee
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Inpatient Bed Huddles

These must occur at least daily and they must be actionable to achieve goals the hospital-wide flow committee has set. Each unit should be represented in the bed huddle and leave with individual action items to discharge patients, prevent delays, and address surges. Expedited admissions to inpatient units and the timely transition of patients to admission should be everyone\'s priority as it produces the best possible outcome for patients.

During huddles, best practices such as early inpatient discharge (before noon), unit discharge rounds, a "pull until full" philosophy with "zero tolerance" for hiding beds, and elimination of unit-specific bed control should be monitored and reinforced. High-performing organizations utilize an afternoon bed huddle to follow up on action items identified earlier in the day and the results they have generated or the need to escalate to others. During times of surge, these same organizations move their inpatient bed huddles to the ED to generate urgency in patient transition and to facilitate inpatient leader rounding.

### Inpatient Leader Rounding

Inpatient leader rounding, in which the inpatient leader rounds on boarded ED patients, is another key tactic to support the actions of the hospital-wide flow committee. Before implementing inpatient leader rounding, ED leaders must generate engagement by sharing the "why,"---the benefits for inpatient leaders to rounding with their patients, before emphasizing the "what" and "how."

Inpatient leader rounding ensures both safety (e.g., a safe handoff and safe acceptance of inpatients) and quality (e.g., improved morbidity and mortality). By connecting inpatient leaders with patients holding in the emergency department, we also establish ownership for the transition, building trust. (Staff rounding on patients reduces anxiety around unexplained and uncertain waits for better clinical outcomes; [@R6].) Frequency of inpatient leader rounding on ED patients is tied to the hospital surge plan with clear guidance and instruction for inpatient units and defined roles and expectations for staff and physicians at tiered surge levels. Inpatient leader rounding is driven by the chief nursing executive or other senior leader sponsor.

The inpatient nurse manager or charge nurse rounds on ED patients awaiting admission in the emergency department. By role modeling rounding, patients are introduced to the rounding process they will experience on the inpatient unit. In starting this practice, it is recommended to begin on one or two pilot units to conduct a test of change using the institution\'s change management philosophy (e.g., plan-do-study-act).

When inpatient leaders round, the goal is to use good listening skills (e.g., refrain from interrupting or rushing the patient), repeat back concerns to ensure that the patient was heard, express a genuine apology where appropriate, thank the patient for entrusting the hospital with his care, express empathy, and explain specifically what the leader will do to address a concern without blaming others or offering excuses.

The inpatient leader should leave a business card and write his or her name and contact information on the ED communication/care board. In addition, the unit phone number is provided to family and visitors. To ensure both effective collaboration and a positive patient experience, the inpatient leader must never "manage down" the admissions process. Rather, it is imperative to reinforce the excellent care patients are currently receiving in the emergency department and share positive steps occurring in process for the transition to inpatient care.

There are many direct benefits to inpatient leaders who round on patients in the emergency department. They ensure that the patient is appropriate for the unit and nursing assignment as well as proactively addressing special needs before transitioning to the inpatient unit. In this way, the inpatient unit can exceed patient\'s expectations with respect to pain, cultural issues, and spiritual care. In short, inpatient leader rounding on ED patients improves patients\' perception of care, which is reflected on patients\' ratings on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey.

CONCLUSION
==========

Over the years, emergency departments have tried many tools and tactics to improve back-end flow. These range from expanding the emergency department by building more rooms; using special discharge or observation units when at full capacity; utilizing ED nurses as inpatient nurses with boarded patients; ambulance diversions; and in the emergency department. However, boarding is not an ED problem. It requires effective, consistent hospital-wide collaboration to facilitate timely admission to inpatient units as well as ongoing monitoring, measurement, and real-time process improvement by a hospital-wide throughput committee.

When ED leaders focus their efforts on partnership and collaboration rather than isolation and finger-pointing, many barriers to resolve the issues before them can quickly erode. As difficult as it can sometimes be, challenging ourselves to elevate above the potential for conflict and reach across boundaries to the inpatient world will deliver the best results for our patients. To accomplish this and to gain and maintain credibility with our inpatient colleagues, we must ensure that we have first addressed internal ED flow issues to the best of our abilities. This will generate evidence of our own ability to change, improve care quality, and generate results that impact all patients. With this type of "you go first" change leadership, anything is possible!

ake no mistake about it - the 2014 NFL Draft will prove absolutely crucial to the Rams' hopes to find success in the years ahead. Two first round picks to play with, a glut of potential compensatory picks at the back end and a relatively light list of needs that haven't been addressed with young talent.
Wide receiver isn't a position the Rams have ignored in recent years. Unlike the offensive line, which certainly has some fans looking to upgrade early, the Rams have made concerted efforts to add to the WR corps early in the draft.
In the last four years, the Rams have drafted seven wideouts before the 5th round, with only Greg Salas and Mardy Gilyard no longer on the team. The current grouping of Tavon Austin, Stedman Bailey, Chris Givens, Brian Quick and Austin Pettis are all in-house draft selections. With the current CW bouncing around the league that the only path to success is to draft your roster up and develop within, there's case to be made that the Rams would be wise to give this group another year to improve and gel collectively.
That case is wrong.
The Rams haven't employed a single wide receiver who gained more than 700 yards in a season since Torry Holt. Last year, 54 players (wideouts and tight ends) topped 700 yards.The Super Bowl Champions Seattle Seahawks (Disgusting. My fingers just threw up typing that for the first time) had two receivers, Golden Tate and Doug Baldwin, break that mark. Their Super Bowl opponent, the Broncos, had four.
San Francisco and Arizona, the other two NFC opponents the Rams have to deal with, each had a pair top 700.Roddy White gained 711 yards playing on one leg made out of leg and the other made out of wet paper in an offense that relied on a sieve where an offensive line should be. In 13 games.
In fact the Rams were (emphasis coming entirely mine...) THE ONLY TEAM IN THE NFC WITHOUT A RECEIVER TO GAIN MORE THAN 700 YARDS.
That's pitiful.
We've seen the need. A 3rd and 6 without a possession receiver who's reliable to pick up a first down consistently. A red zone opportunity that fails because the Rams lack a credible threat to run a fade. The hesitancy on the part of Sam Bradford to throw up a ball for a receiver in one-on-one coverage because he's not sure that the target won't lose out on a battle to play the ball at the highest point.
This, more than anything else facing the Rams right now, has to be fixed. It has to. There is no way the Rams will approach the playoffs in 2014 unless this gets right.
Now there is a hopeful plea out there that Brian Quick suddenly becomes that guy this year. And sure, it's possible. But the Rams can't rely on that. You're talking about an NFL franchise. Success and failure in the NFL are millions of dollars apart. Nobody in the front office should be putting millions of dollars of potential revenue and a renewed faith in the franchise on Brian Quick's shoulders.
They have to draft a guy, and he has to hit.
That's the bottom line. Sammy Watkins, Mike Evans, Marqise Lee, Kelvin Benjamin, Insert Name Here, Jr. -- it doesn't matter. It just has to work.
Personally feeling this is the only true absolute need for the Rams, I'd think they'd want this wrapped up before the 13th pick. If they don't have ultimate confidence that there's a perfect fit to grab at #2 at value and end up trading down, they've got to take their guy where ever they drop to. If they're not sure he'll be there when they're on the clock, then they just can't trade down and hope. Nobody should be putting millions of dollars of potential revenue and a renewed faith in the franchise on hope's shoulders either.
The upcoming season is pivotal. It's Sam Bradford's fifth upon a return from a devastating injury. It's the third for both Head Coach Jeff Fisher and Les Snead. And it's the last season on the stadium lease...like I said, it's pivotal.
And nothing would help the Rams pivot toward the successful side of life more than a wide receiver that inspires confidence in his quarterback, the team and the fans as a whole.

Id love to have a top notch WR, but the fact remains that O-line is still our top priority. It's not flashy or as impact perceived as WR, but the best WR in the world won't get the rock without an o line to protect the qb. I'm not sayin we have to draft a lineman at 2, but it damn sure needs to be a focus.
We have Austin, Cook and Givens with a splash of Bailey, Pettis and Quick. That should be enough to move the chains consistently if SB has time in the pocket.
We're a run first team, we need a damn good o-line to stay committed to that philosophy.

Nobody should be putting millions of dollars of potential revenue and a renewed faith in the franchise on hope's shoulders either.
The upcoming season is pivotal. It's Sam Bradford's fifth upon a return from a devastating injury. It's the third for both Head Coach Jeff Fisher and Les Snead. And it's the last season on the stadium lease...like I said, it's pivotal.
And nothing would help the Rams pivot toward the successful side of life more than a wide receiver that inspires confidence in his quarterback, the team and the fans as a whole.

A top WR would be great, however I have to agree with the group and say OL is far and away the top priority at this point.

I'm not one to expect any rookie to actually be at "Go-To" level in their first year. I think adding Sammy's threat would open up things for the other WRs on our offense right away though. I would expect some big scoring plays from him during year one,,, along with some chain-moving plays on 3rd down.

I agree, many are suggesting go OL which makes sense but, I think Watkins finishes the WR corps. I expect the Rams to draft a few OL players I'm just guessing it will be later in the draft.

With a top 6 pick, I like impact players. Imagine if we passed on Torry Holt in 1999? Not saying Watkins is Holt, but it's about stock piling good players and that spans a length of time well beyond 2014.

I still don't understand why people think a "#1" WR is so important in the NFL, and PARTICULARLY for a Jeff Fisher coached team. When has he ever deployed a high octane, vertical offense? It seems to me that he values tough, possession WRs that can make catches in traffic and move the chains. He has made no secret that he wants to establish dominance at the LOS (on both sides) and win in the trenches, beginning with the ground game. Not saying I agree, just saying that it is how his teams typically roll. I love Watkins, but I think we have a very good, young WR nucleus already and they are going to be sufficient for this offense. Just my opinion. I would like to see us build a young, deep DOMINANT OL. I think that is how we win in this division.

Not saying I disagree with you but it sure seemed like McNair threw for a lot of yards.

If anything the rams groupOf wr's should be all on the same page with each other and with sam. That should help the passing game tremendously. Now when the rams fortify the OL with some quality players then stacy and Bradford will be able to post some very nice numbers. I truly believe Quick will have a breakout year, I believe it

Since we already have a starting LT, there's no sense in picking OL early in the first round.

We can get an RT and a G or 2 later.

Here's the thing, I'm not worried about what positions we get where, I'm just worried about getting the best players possible. I'm not saying we need to pass up a superior WR just to get an O-lineman, I'm saying that we don't need to go out of our way to get a WR, because as long as Sam has enough time in the pocket, the receivers we have right now are talented enough to get the job done. Otoh, If he doesn't have enough time in the pocket, the discussion is moot either way because we're going to fail no matter what WRs we have out there. If there's a better prospect than Watkins wherever we end up drafting (at this point I have Clowney, Robinson, and Matthews higher on my big board), then we need to draft that player.

Watkins after we trade out of #2 sounds good to me, if Quick does come around then you have a potentially dangerous WR corp with Watkins there, if Quick doest pan out you at least have a #1 type WR in the wings. Oline can be addressed in the second through 4th rounds IMO as we really only need depth at OT, we can get a starting OG in round 2 or 3.

What I see is not high octane offense just a better version of the Schotty O. I think the WR group is very good and that Watkins makes the group better by dictating coverage rather than reacting to it. Watkins outside the numbers is more dangerous than Givens, Quick, Austin, or Bailey giving them a better combination of matchups across the group.

I see more wiggle room to address the OL due to already having starting LT, RT, C already on the team. The guards TBD.

<|endoftext|>Luce d'Eramo

Luce d’Eramo (June 17, 1925 in Reims – March 6, 2001 in Rome) was an Italian writer and literary critic. She is best known for her autobiographical novel Deviazione, which recounts her experiences in Germany during World War II. D’Eramo’s writings are characterized by interest toward controversial subjects and a search of solutions that would liberate people from physical and mental constraints.

Biography

Early life

Luce d’Eramo (née Lucette Mangione) was born in 1925 in Reims, France. The daughter of Italian parents, she lived in France until the age of fourteen.

Her father, an illustrator and painter, lived in Paris from 1912 until 1915 and went back to Italy to fight in the Italian army during the First World War, as a military airplane pilot.  After the war he got married and the couple moved back to France where he started a building company. Luce was the youngest of three daughters, of whom the oldest one died in infancy. Her mother served as a voluntary secretary of the Italian Fascio in Paris assisting Italian immigrant workers.

In 1938 Luce and her family returned to Italy and stayed at her maternal grandmother’s house in Alatri, near Rome. There Luce attended a classical liceo (high school).  The change of scene proved a social and cultural shock as Luce tried to adjust to her new life in Italy. The Parisian reality with its modern values and diverse political movements (in 1936, members of the workers’ Front Populaire held demonstrations directly below their house) was in sharp contrast to the backward reality of the Ciociaria region, where processions of barefoot pilgrims walked to the Sanctuary of the Certosa di Trisulti, singing at the top of their voices.  Priests and monks were everywhere because their convent stood right behind her grandmother’s garden. In Io sono un’aliena, Luce recalled how children in France branded her as the “petite macaroni” (the little macaroni girl) which her Italian classmates from Liceo “Conti Gentili” replaced with a condescending “la francesina” (the little French girl). The sense of separateness, of being an outsider without any permanent roots contributed to d’Eramo’s deep sensitivity to the plight of “the other.”

Youth and the war

After the outbreak of World War II, her father joined the military service as a pilot and later started working for the news office of the air force.  The family moved to Rome where Lucetta (as the family called her) attended the last year at the classical liceo “Umberto” (now “Pilo Albertelli”).  After graduation she enrolled in the Faculty of Letters at the university of Rome and became a member of GUF (Association of Fascist Students), a natural choice for a girl brought up in a fascist family.

After the fall of fascism, on July 25, 1943, Luce followed her family to Bassano del Grappa in northern Italy, where her father was nominated to be the undersecretary of the air force in the Republic of Salò (a puppet state led by Mussolini and supported by Nazi Germany and Italian fascist loyalists). While in Bassano del Grappa, Luce heard disturbing news about mass deportations and atrocities committed in Nazi camps.  Torn between the idealistic loyalty to fascism and her own, ever-growing doubts, on February 7, 1944, she decided to find out the truth.

She left her family to take on a job as a factory worker in Germany and was sent to a labor camp at the Siemens plant, and later at the IG Farben plant in Frankfurt. The brutal awakening to the cruel reality of oppression and exploitation carried on in the camps pushed her to take an active part in the resistance against the Nazis.  She supported the Russian prisoners in solidarity with their plight and participated in a strike organized by the French resistance. After being imprisoned she tried to commit suicide. Because of her family’s political position she was released and sent to Italy.  On her way back home, passing through Verona, she realized that she could not return to her previous life.  She threw away her documents, joined a group of deportees being sent to Germany, and ended up in the Dachau concentration camp.  She escaped from the camp during an air raid and began the nomadic life of a clandestine vagrant, taking on the most menial jobs to survive in a Germany plagued by relentless air raids of the Allied forces.  On February 27, 1945, in Mainz, Luce was helping rescue the wounded buried under the rubble of a bombed building when a wall crumbled on top of her.  She was gravely injured and the damage to her spine caused permanent paralysis to both legs, resulting in a handicap that would impact the rest of her life.

Post-war period

After the war ended, Luce returned to Italy and spent some time in Bologna as a patient in the Rizzoli Clinic where she met Pacifico d’Eramo, a survivor of the Russian campaign recovering from sustained injuries.  They married and moved to Rome, where Pacifico became a professor of philosophy.  They had a son, Marco, who was born in 1947. The marriage turned unhappy and ended in separation years later. Luce continued to use her married name even after the divorce.

Once back in Italy, Luce resumed her studies, earning both her degrees in literature in 1951 (with a thesis on the poetics of Giacomo Leopardi) and philosophy in 1954 (with a thesis on Kant’s Critique of Judgment).

After the publication of her first book Idilli in coro by a small publishing house in 1951, she met Alberto Moravia who admired her as a writer and accepted her short story Thomasbräu (later included in the novel Deviazione) for a prestigious magazine, “Nuovi Argomenti.”  Next came a highly original essay entitled Raskolnikow and Marxism, (1960, reprinted in 1997) in 
which she engaged with  Moravia in a discussion regarding the Soviet Union.

In Finché la testa vive (1963), a short novel also later included in Deviazione, she confronted the trauma of being confined to a wheelchair at the age of nineteen.  
In 1966 her writing career was profoundly affected by an encounter with Ignazio Silone, who became her lifelong friend and the subject of an acute critical study L’opera di Ignazio Silone published by Arnoldo Mondadori in 1971. In this monumental piece of meticulous research and original insight, d’Eramo examines the resistance of the Italian cultural milieu to a native Italian writer who achieved world fame as one of the greatest figures of the literary scene in the twentieth century.

In the years of the so-called “strategy of tension,” d’Eramo’s friend, Camilla Cederna (a Milanese journalist) brought to her attention the case of Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, the famous publisher who, according to the official version and the police, was blown up while placing an explosive under a high-voltage pole.  D’Eramo’s essay "Cruciverba politico. Come funziona in Italia la strategia della diversione", offers a penetrating analysis of how the Italian press handled this case.

D’Eramo rose to fame with the novel Deviazione, begun a few years after her return to Italy, but eventually finished and published over thirty years later, in 1979.  Deviazione is an autobiographical novel that recounts the dramatic events experienced in her youth.  It is also a mystery of memory: the memory of a deeply wounded woman who had to contend with the difficulty of recovering the true meaning of her war experience in the post-war context and of returning to the social sphere she had so hard struggled to escape.

After Deviazione d’Eramo published several other novels and short stories. She spent the rest of her life writing and travelling in Europe, United States, and Japan.  In 1980 she spent a year in Berlin as a writer guest of the DAAD (Deutscher Akademiker Austauschdienst [The German Academic Exchange Service]).

During the entirety of her career as a writer, d’Eramo also collaborated with a variety of magazines (Nuovi Argomenti, La Fiera Letteraria, Studi Cattolici, Nuova Antologia, Tempo Presente) and newspapers (Il manifesto, L’Unità and Avvenire).

She died in Rome on March 6, 2001.  She was buried at the Non-Catholic Cemetery in Rome (also referred to as the Protestant Cemetery or the Cemetery for Foreigners) where John Keats, P. B. Shelley, and Antonio Gramsci are also buried.

Works

D’Eramo’s writings have always gravitated toward uneasy or controversial subjects, in search of solutions that would liberate people from thousands of physical and mental constraints. This pursuit would lead them toward a better knowledge of the self and an acceptance of the unknown and of “the other,” abolishing barriers that divide and exclude, thus allowing for a congenial coexistence on our planet, a tiny speck in the universe.  
	
After addressing the issues of Nazism and World War II in Deviazione and in short stories (collected in 1999 under the title Racconti quasi di guerra), Luce d’Eramo has confronted a variety of hard situations, involving social and psychological problems: the fight of dissident communist groups during the period of terror and “urban guerrilla” in Italy, called “the years of lead,” in the novel Nucleo Zero (1981); the plight of the elderly in Ultima luna (1993); the emotional deafness of young nazi skinheads in Si prega di non disturbare (1995); the mental illness in Una strana fortuna (1997); and finally, in Un’estate difficile, the psychological portrait of a domineering husband and a wife who fights for autonomy and faces the break-up of her marriage, despite the rigid social and cultural conditions existing in Italy in the fifties.

The novel which d’Eramo herself regarded as her favorite was Partiranno (1986).  It is a poignant chronicle of the stay on earth of the Nnoberavezi, gentle aliens who thirst for knowledge.  D’Eramo’s passionate interest in them stems from her own sense of “alienation,” as she revealed in her last book-interview Io sono un’aliena, published in 1999, two years before her death.
	
Her best-known work Deviazione became a bestseller and sold hundreds of thousands of copies.  It was translated into French, German, and Japanese.  The novel Nucleo Zero, translated into German and Spanish, was adapted into a movie directed by Carlo Lizzani in 1984.  Excerpts from Una strana fortuna (A Strange Fate) were translated into English and appeared in the anthology Resisting Bodies, Narratives of Italian Women Partisans (2008).

Politics
A swing county in the first eight decades after the Civil War, Edgar County has since become powerfully Republican. It has been carried by only two Democrats since 1940 – Lyndon Johnson in 1964 by just 139 votes, and Bill Clinton in 1992 by a 41.1 percent plurality. Like all of the Upland South it has seen drastic swings away from the Democratic Party in the past few elections due to opposition to that party’s liberal views on social issues: Hillary Clinton’s 22.7 percent vote share in 2016 was by 9.3 percent the worst ever by a Democrat in the county.

“Hold on a second, citizen. Before you have that thought, you should consider this other thought we prepared earlier for you.”

It would be hard to conceive of a more partisan or rigged social media platform than Facebook, but that clearly isn’t enough for Facebook, because it has just outdone itself, introducing a tool that allows users to flag any story they may dislike or disagree with as “fake news.” Welcome to the Facebook fake news flagging system.

One can just picture the armies of Establishment trolls and shills salivating at the prospect of being able to dispute any and every item that shows upon Facebook which they don’t like as “fake news,” making it even harder than it already is for independent news outlets to be seen and heard by the people who need to be reached the most (the people who need waking up so they can become part of the solution).

But wait, can’t intelligent, well-researched individuals in turn report outlets they would consider to be sources of bogus information, like the Washington Post, New York Times, and other Establishment-approved sources? Why, no, of course not, this is a one way street. As NBC (an Establishment outlet) notes, “legitimate news outlets won’t be able to be flagged.“

Er, so who occupies the mighty throne of Arbiter of Truth to determine what is a “legitimate” outlet and what is not?

Why, a legion of Establishment outlets of course!

Here’s what will happen: flagged stories – any viewpoint a Facebooker happens to dislike – will be reviewed by Facebook “researchers” and sent on to third-party “fact-checking” organizations for further “verification” — or simply marked as fake. The post, after being “assessed” by the third-party “checkers” will show up as “disputed” should they deign to make it so.

Rest easy, citizen, it will be “respectable” entities like Snopes (hard not to laugh out loud here), Politifact, and Factcheck.org who will be doing your thinking for you from now on. You can definitely trust them to sort the wheat from the chaff. Go back to sleeeeeep…

There, doesn’t that feel better without all that naughty brain-hurty “thinky” stuff going on?

A group of Facebook researchers will initially have the responsibility of sifting through flagged stories and determining which ones to send to the fact-checking organizations. If it’s determined to be fake, the story will be flagged as disputed and include a link explaining why. These stories can still be shared, but you’ll be warned before you do and they’ll be more likely to appear lower in News Feed. These stories also won’t be able to be promoted or turned into advertisements.1 [emphasis added]

Facebook’s algorithm that decides what gets the most prominence in News Feed, is also to be tweaked. It doesn’t take a genius to realise that any such “tweaks” made will be to the benefit of the Establishment outlets, and to the detriment (reduced visibility) of the truly independent news media outlets (like us, for instance) that aren’t massively funded by Big Pharma and/or totally on board with enabling/protecting the global Satanic pedophile network (have you been following the Podesta situation and PizzaGate?).

The hypocrisy on the point of funding is staggering. Facebook’s VP claims that they want to hit “fake news” sites in the pocket1 because, after all, they have ads on them and stuff, mmkay? Mainstream media receives its funding HOW, exactly? Donations from unicorns?

To continue putting this in perspective…

That’s right, not only will the pedophile protectors be given prominence in Facebook’s news feed, but only the “legitimate news outlets” bearing the Establishment’s seal of approval will be immune to flagging.

Everyone else is fair game.

That means that any site trying to protect or assist the victims by exposing the global pedophile/Satanic ritual abuse network is particularly vulnerable to Facebook’s Orwellian “fake news” flagging system, while those who actively shield those abhorrent networks of imbalanced and psychopathic people by pretending it’s not happening, or publishing F-grade “debunking” articles will be rewarded with immunity and increased visibility.

But then, what else would we expect from an organization whose founder is openly aligned with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which so aggressively pursues the global depopulation agenda under the guise of bringing “medicine” to countries in the developing world, while Gates himself devotedly funds a multitude of the most reprehensible companies on earth, while pretending to be environmentally concerned.

More on the motive for the fake news flagging system

Zuckerburg’s comments are revealing:

Days after Donald Trump was elected president, Zuckerberg said it was “pretty crazy” to think fake news could have influenced the election… (nbcnews.com)

So, we wonder who has been in Mr Z’s ear whispering not-so-sweet nothings about the problem of alternative media, especially given that the Establishment/pedophile network’s selected puppet Hillary Clinton didn’t get in over Trump. That must have stung a bit. In case you’re wondering, Podesta is firmly connected in to the Clinton network, so it is no coincidence that the news outlets most loudly promoting her were also the same ones downplaying, debunking, or ignoring the Podesta/PizzaGate scandal.

Facebook’s reputation is deservedly going to the dogs with increasing alacrity.1 Censoring news media outlets such as Wikileaks and Anonymous (to name but two) who are trying to dismantle a global criminal enterprise says a lot about where Facebook’s allegiance lies.

Get ready for the next level of censorship, folks – that is, unless you solve it once and for all by doing the one thing Facebook doesn’t want you to do:

Leave.

If legions of conscientious people were to abandon the social media behemoth, it would lose massive revenue, and if the situation were serious enough, it may even need to reconsider such openly biased and repugnant censorship strategies and opt for something more subtle, and perhaps bearable for those of us who may yet still find some use or value in this platform which so many view as a “necessary evil” (for now). (But before you deactivate, you’ll want to see what we’re cooking up for January. Or just subscribe at the very top of the page. ???? )

Facebook’s arrogance and contempt for its users may yet be its undoing.

<|endoftext|>Michael Morse wasn’t the sharpest pencil in the box in the Washington Nationals clubhouse when he was here. Nice guy, good for some laughs, but if the clubhouse ever had to show up for a collective IQ test, let’s just say it would be a good time for Morse to take one of his many trips to the disabled list.

Why does he get called dumb? Because Morse reiterated his displeasure at the Nationals shutting down Stephen Strasburg two years ago. And, apparently, because Morse said nice things about the fans in San Francisco compared to the fans in Washington.

Obviously people have different opinions about the Strasburg thing, but I don’t think it’s a matter of intelligence like Loverro says it is. No matter what you may have done in that situation, there is no set of hard facts or evidence that suggests you were 100% correct. Personally I’d love to have pitched Strasburg in the playoffs, but I have no guarantee that’d he’d do better or that he wouldn’t have hurt himself. Loverro thinks differently and thinks anyone who disagrees with him is a dolt. He has no definitive evidence to support his case either.

But more than just classless for calling Morse dumb, Loverro’s column is plain wrong too. He says the Nationals are better off without Morse. This despite Morse putting up way better numbers playing mostly left field than the Nats’ primary left fielder in Bryce Harper’s absence — Nate McLouth — has. And Adam LaRoche missed time at first too. Think having Morse cover for those two might have been a good thing for the Nats?

Just a weird bitter column written, apparently, as a sop to those fans who took personal offense to Morse not saying Nats fans were the best ever. Which is a really silly basis on which to waste column inches.

Former Mets catcher Johnny Monell signed a contract with the KT Wiz of the Korea Baseball Organization, per a report by Chris Cotillo of SB Nation. The 30-year-old originally struck a deal with the NC Dinos on Thursday, but the deal appeared to fall through at the last minute, according to Cotillo’s unnamed source.

Monell last surfaced for the Mets during their 2015 run, batting a dismal .167/.231/.208 with two extra bases in 52 PA before the club DFA’d him to clear space for Bartolo Colon. While he’s had difficulty sticking at the major league level, he’s found a higher degree of success in the minor league circuit and holds a career .271 average over a decade of minor league play. He played exclusively in Triple-A Las Vegas during the 2016 season, slashing .276/.336/.470 with 19 home runs and a career-high 75 RBI in 461 PA.

The veteran backstop appears to be the second MLB player to join the KT Wiz roster this offseason, as right-hander Donn Roach also signed with the club last month on a one-year, $850,000 deal.

Brewers’ right-hander Phil Bickford received a 50-game suspension after testing positive for a drug of abuse, per the Los Angeles Times’ Bill Shaikin. This is the second time Bickford has been suspended for recreational drug use, as he was previously penalized in 2015 after testing positive for marijuana prior to the amateur draft.

Bickford was selected by the Giants in the first round of the 2015 draft and was later dealt to the Brewers for lefty reliever Will Smith at the 2016 trade deadline. He finished his 2016 campaign in High-A Brevard County, pitching to a 3.67 ERA, 10.0 K/9 rate and 5.0 BB/9 over 27 innings.

Two other suspensions were handed down on Friday, one to Toronto minor league right-hander Pedro Loficial for a positive test for metabolites of Stanozolol and one to Miami minor league outfielder Casey Soltis for a second positive test for drugs of abuse. Loficial will serve a 72-game suspension, while Soltis will serve 50 games. All three suspensions are due to start at the beginning of the 2017 season for each respective minor league team.

We are very disappointed to learn of Phil’s suspension, but we fully support the Minor League Baseball Drug Prevention and Testing Program and its enforcement by the Commissioner’s Office. Phil understands he made a mistake, and we fully anticipate that he will learn from this experience.<|endoftext|>Erling Braut Haland 2019/20 – Scout Report

On the 23rd of July last year, we published an analysis of a young player who was starting to make significant waves in football. That player was the young Norwegian forward Erling Braut Haland. At the time of writing the forward player was still playing his football with his boyhood club Molde, in his native Norway.

We ended the article by stating our hope that Haland would make a smart move when he left Molde as the giants of European football were circling and that it is all too easy for a young player to have his head turned. Thankfully we need not have been concerned. The young forward player did leave Norway but his move was to Red Bull Salzburg in the Austrian Bundesliga. In pure qualitative terms, you could argue that there is not much difference between the Norwegian Eliteserien and the Austrian Bundesliga but in terms of clubs, Red Bull Salzburg are on a whole other level.

Renowned for identifying, recruiting and developing young players Salzburg is the perfect platform for a player like Haland. With that said, however, there are already rumblings that the Norwegian may not be at the club for long with his performances so far this season only serving to attract more potential suitors.

Given the rate of development that we have seen from Haland over the last 15 months, we felt as though the time was right to write a fresh analysis of his game. In this tactical analysis, we will discuss the individual components that make Haland a special talent.

Statistical Breakdown

Our scout report will analyse Haland from the tactical perspective, and first of all, it’s worth looking into his season so far from a statistical perspective, especially because those statistics are so startling. To date, at club level, he has played 713 first-team minutes over the course of 9 matches. In that time he has already scored 14 times and assisted 4 more. That gives a total of 1.77 goals and 0.5 assists per 90 minutes.

The other underlying statistics that are notable for a forward player are equally impressive. The youngster has so far registered 4.8 shots at goal per 90, 4.92 dribbles per 90 and 2.15 ball recoveries in the opposition half per 90.

The shot map for the young forward so far this season also paints an interesting picture. He is adept at shooting from all areas of the final third but his shot selection is largely limited, with one or two exceptions, to the 18-yard-box. He takes shots from positions that will yield a relatively high xG.

In short, the 19-year-old Norwegian international is something of a statistical marvel.

Movement

The first thing that strikes you when you see Erling Haland play is his frame. He stands 6 ft. 4 tall with a broad frame and long limbs- it is frightening to think that he is likely to add muscle to that frame over the next two to three years. When strikers of that physical profile are developed there is a tendency for them to become accustomed to receiving the ball into his feet or body from direct passes as their teammates take advantage of their ability to hold up the ball. How often have we seen it? A team plays a tall, strong forward and the ball is continuously played in a direct fashion to them in order to access the final third?

Here is the thing that is still catching opponents out though, Haland does not want the ball played into him in this fashion. He wants the ball played in behind the defensive line so that he can run beyond the defensive line and into space. He possesses the spatial awareness and pace to take advantage of any spaces in the opposition defensive line. This plays to the strengths of this Red Bull Salzburg side and their American coach Jesse Marsch.

The Norwegian forward excels at finding pockets of space in between the opposition defensive players. He constantly pulls off the shoulders of the central defenders in order to occupy their blindside or drift into channels that will allow his teammates to play him through. We see this above as Haland has occupied space between two opposition defenders. He has the pace to get on the end of the through ball before the defenders can close him down. From that point, he is very difficult to stop as he has the physical capacity to hold off chasing defenders and break into the penalty area.

Haland also displays an excellent reading of the play in moments of quick transition. The image above shows a direct pass that had been flicked on behind the opposition defence by his strike partner. This form of chance is slightly harder for a young striker as it is not the result of a pre-planned pattern of play that has been worked on at the training ground. Instead, we can see that the positioning and movement in order to find and occupy space is instinctive.

Even in these situations though Haland has drifted into a pocket of space between two defensive players. As the ball loops forward and drops into space behind the defensive line he is the quickest to react and as before, as soon as he is ahead of the defenders, he is incredibly difficult to stop.

These movements create the opportunities on goal in the penalty area for Haland but he still has to have the composure to finish. He has this in abundance displaying the ability to score all types of goals. Left-foot, right-foot, headers, goals from counters or from crosses. Across the goalkeeper or into the near post. Rarely have we seen a young forward with the sheer range of attacking tools that Haland has at his disposal.

Creativity

It is easy to get lost in the goals scored by Haland, 1.77 goals per 90 – and let’s not forget that he scored an incredible 9 goals in one match in the U20 World Cup for Norway against Honduras. We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that he is also a creative force capable of drawing opposition players into him before playing through passes to teammates.

For his club side, we have seen Marsch prefer a 4-2-2-2 shape so far this season with a brief moment using 3-5-2. In either scenario though there are two forward players who play off of one another to combine and create goalscoring opportunities. As the hype around Haland continues to increase we will see more and more teams trying to double him up and close him down in the final third. This will, in turn, create spaces for teammates that Haland can help to exploit.

We see this in action above. Haland, having picked up possession of the ball out on the left-hand side having driven inside. This movement from the Norwegian is the trigger for vertical movements from other RB Salzburg players. The Austrian side plays an extremely vertical style with players always making forward runs to stretch the opposition defence and threaten the space in behind the defence. As the Norwegian cuts across, the closest defender is isolated and pinned. As the far side player makes his run Haland simply slips the through ball past the defence to create a goal.

We see a similar situation above but this time Haland is moving forward in a period of quick transition. RB Salzburg are superb when they attack teams before their defensive block can be set. This time Haland is driving forward on the right-hand side and he is isolated against a single defensive player. We have already seen in the statistical section that he is a strong dribbler of the ball and we see that here. With the defensive player having shifted over to the wide space, Haland attacks him on the inside and as soon as he finds space, he creates the through ball for the running forward on the far side. Another goalscoring chance created for his teammate.

Awareness

So far we have touched upon the movement and creativity displayed by Haland so far this season for RB Salzburg. These would be less effective if they were not combined with an awareness that is unusual for a player so young. We see Haland drift into pockets of space as we have seen above but we also see him read the opposition and the pattern of play before making decisive movements that allow his teammates to progress the ball forward.

In the example above we see the attacking move shift into the second phase as the defensive side have cleared the ball. The player for RB Salzburg has the ball wide and it looks as though he will simply look to lift the ball back into the penalty area. Haland reads this and makes a quick and decisive movement from the centre to the outside into space. This allows the ball to be played down the outside and the Norwegian forward is able to break into the penalty area to create a chance for his side.

This time we see the pace, power and commitment from Haland to support the attacking movement and score a goal for his side. The forward had started the attacking play by winning the ball back in the midfield before playing it straight through for an attacking teammate to move in on goal. The defending team are so out of position that there is only one defensive player against for RB Salzburg attackers. It would be easy in this position for Haland to hand back and not put in the effort required to catch up with play. Instead, as the defender gets back and covers one potential pass while he engages the ball, we see Haland run around the outside of the ball carrier for an easy pass and an easy goal. Once again he has read the play and responded brilliantly.

Conclusion

The development that we have seen from Erling Haland over the last 15 months is nothing short of staggering. When we profiled him last year it seemed a sure thing that he would become a top-class forward but we did not think that it would happen this quickly. A hat-trick in his first Champions League match has firmly drawn the attention of the world’s media and Haland is now on his way to becoming a household name across the footballing world.

What is truly frightening is that at 19-years-old he is far from the finished product. If he continues to develop, and he is in the perfect place to do so, then he will go on to become one of the top strikers in the world. The consensus seems to be that RB Leipzig will take advantage of their close relationship to the Austrian side to take Haland to Germany. There is perhaps another option for the Norweigian with the giants of English football monitoring his situation. There is no doubt that any side lucky enough to sign Haland will be getting a remarkable goalscorer.

Landscape and Horticultural Technicians and Specialists

Review specifications written by contractors, architects and designers. For example, read tree planting specifications written by contractors to ensure that provisions have been made for tree protection in landscape architecture projects and landscape maintenance contracts. (2)

Refer to building codes, zoning regulations, by-laws and other provincial and municipal regulations to ensure that landscape designs, procedures and practices are compliant with rules and regulations. For example, check on the requirements for the landscaping of sites bordering bodies of water. (3)

Read articles in scientific journals such as the Journal of Arboriculture, Journal de la Société internationale d'arboriculture, Compendium of Turfgrass Diseases and Turfgrass Science and Culture to learn about plant breeding experiments, the control of destructive pests or the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as Sudden Oak Death. These articles contain specialized terminology intended for an expert audience. (4)

Write letters to accompany tenders for the construction or maintenance of gardens, parks, golf courses and other landscaped environments. Use templates and modify previous letters as necessary to create new invitations. (2)

Write investigation reports following the discovery of damaged or diseased trees, shrubs, plants or turf. These reports vary in length and complexity, but each of them describes the nature of the problem, the variables investigated to identify causes and the outcome of the investigation. (3)

Write responses to requests for proposals for landscape design work. Address key components of the requests and convey complex horticultural and landscaping concepts in an effective manner. It is usually necessary to gather and select technical descriptions from multiple sources and adapt them for non-technical audiences. (4)

Prepare detailed descriptions of work to be completed such as instructions for employees and comprehensive specifications for contractors. These instructions and specifications comprise a detailed description of tasks to be performed, inorganic and organic materials to be used, time frames to be achieved and other contract requirements. (4)

Write articles for newsletters, newspapers and magazines to inform peers about specific horticultural and business issues and introduce the public to general gardening practices and new products. For example, write about environmentally-sound ways of controlling pests and maintaining the health and appearance of trees, shrubs, plants and lawns. (4)

Identify and use a variety of icons to search websites for information on trees, shrubs, evergreens, roses, bulbs, herbs, perennials, bedding plants and other horticultural products. (2)

Check coloured pictures of varied types of diseases to assess the health and conditions of trees, shrubs, plants and lawns. (2)

Read assembly drawings to assemble or repair grounds maintenance and other equipment. For example, look at assembly drawings showing the proper way to assemble irrigation pumps or sprinkler heads. (3)

Record details of herbicide, fungicide and pesticide use on reporting forms. For example, complete pesticide application forms to describe the problems diagnosed and the treatment solutions used. (3)

Locate and retrieve data from various tables, schedules and other table-like text. For example, locate information about the composition and health hazard of chemical products on Material Safety Data Sheets and other technical data sheets. (3)

Interpret graphs contained in textbooks, trade publications, scientific journals and websites to learn about the effectiveness of techniques used in the treatment of damaged or diseased trees, shrubs, plants or turf. Combine information from the graphs and accompanying texts to fully understand the effectiveness of techniques. (4)

Review landscape drawings submitted by employees, contractors, designers and property owners to ensure that design criteria have been satisfied and specifications have been met. Take measurements from scale drawings to check that all items have been appropriately represented. (4)

Perform keyword searches to get a variety of information about landscaping and horticulture from websites. Use the Internet to exchange larger files using file transfer protocol software. (2)

Use communication software to exchange email and attachments with contractors and co-workers. (2)

Use word processing to write, edit and format documents such as 'requests for proposals', tenders and reports. (2)

Use computer and software applications. For example, use global positioning systems to verify the geographical coordinates of specific points in parks, golf courses and other landscaped environments. Use photo editing software to enlarge and print photos taken with digital cameras. Use project management software to schedule activities and organize information related to human resources, equipment use and maintenance, and operational costs. (3)

Create spreadsheets to track hours worked by employees and contractors. Enter formulas into spreadsheets to calculate invoice amounts and estimate cost. (3)

Talk to customers and staff at nurseries and greenhouses about plants and plant care. (1)

Give directions to other employees and discuss job tasks with them. For example, discuss the condition of damaged and diseased trees, shrubs, plants and lawns and suggest treatment plans. (2)

Coordinate landscaping design and development processes with experts such as architects and engineers. (2)

Speak with suppliers and contractors to inquire about the availability of materials and supplies, negotiate prices and clarify specifications. For example, speak to contractors to clarify specifications for the construction of gardens, parks, golf courses and other landscaped environments. Be explicit and precise to avoid delays, cost overruns and work which doesn't meet contract requirements. (2)

Speak with peers at trade fairs and association meetings to discuss relevant subjects such as new products and methods for plant propagation, disease control, market trends and certification. (3)

Give presentations to audiences such as clients, council members and peers on matters such as new landscape design projects, the prevalence of invasive insects and the treatment of damaged or diseased trees, shrubs, plants, lawns or turf. People attending these presentations may be unfamiliar with the topics presented and concepts conveyed so adapt the presentation style and language to suit non-specialist audiences. (3)

Speak with clients to assess their needs, get their input in the development of landscape designs and advise them on the maintenance of their landscaped environments. Question clients to identify their budgets, timeframes and preferences. Discuss horticultural issues and recommend trees, shrubberies, plants, lawns, fences, decks, patios and other landscape structures to address clients' needs. (3)

Accept payment for landscaping or horticultural services and make change. (1)

Prepare or approve invoices for the design, construction or maintenance of gardens, parks, golf courses and other landscaped environments. Multiply the numbers of hours worked by hourly rates, add equipment and material costs, calculate applicable taxes and total the amounts. (2)

Calculate or approve travel claim amounts. Calculate reimbursements for the use of personal vehicles at per kilometre rates, and add amounts for accommodation, meals and other expenses. (2)

Review tenders for subcontracted work. Perform comparative analyses of financial data submitted by contractors and determine which bids offer the best prices and most feasible work plans. (3)

Create and monitor budgets for the design, construction or maintenance of gardens, parks, golf courses and other landscaped environments. Ensure that expenses incurred for equipment, organic and inorganic materials and labour remain within budgeted amounts. (4)

Prepare and monitor schedules which identify major activities and target completion dates for the design, construction or maintenance of landscaped environments. For example, horticulture specialists and technicians may prepare schedules for plant cultivating; tree planting, trimming and fertilizing; shrub bed weeding, tilling, edging, raking and mulching; and shrub planting and pruning. They frequently adjust schedules because of weather conditions, loss of staff, or unforeseen outbreaks of diseases. (4)

Determine the quantities of materials and supplies needed for jobs. For example, determine the number of pesticide capsules needed for a job by totalling the diameters of all trees to be treated and dividing the total by the number of centimetres treated per capsule. Determine the quantity of paving stones in square feet required to meet design requirements. Golf course superintendents may determine the amount of sand needed for bunkers by calculating their areas. (2)

Take measurements from landscape drawings to determine location to plant or place shrubs, trees and flowers. (2)

Take various precise measurements. For example, take precise site measurements using laser distance and height instruments. Take a series of measurements of diameters of plant stems and tree trunks at precise intervals as specified in manuals of standards using callipers. (3)

Analyze deviations from schedules and budgets. Compare budgeted amounts to actual expenditures and completion dates to target dates for each activity. Analyse successes and failures and identify lessons learned. For example, determine changes in the prices of organic and inorganic materials and depict trends in those prices. Identify items that were underestimated in previous projects, such as the number of damaged plants to be replaced. It may be possible to improve the accuracy of future cost estimates based on these analyses. (3)

Collect and analyze quantitative data on a number of variables such as diseases, pests and treatments in trees, shrubs, plants and lawns, outside temperatures, rainfalls and soil acidity. Interpret data to identify relationships between variables and assess the effectiveness of treatments. (3)

Estimate the number of hours which should be assigned for various landscape design, construction or maintenance tasks. Use past requirements as a guide but allow time for unexpected difficulties. (2)

Estimate quantities and amounts when preparing budgets for the design, construction and maintenance of landscaped environments which may include trees, shrubberies, lawns, fences, decks, patios and other landscape structures. Take into consideration the quantities and unit costs of organic and inorganic materials and of labour. Factor in the time needed to locate materials and the probability of obtaining volume discounts. It is necessary to be fairly accurate to minimize budget overruns. (3)

Landscape and horticultural technicians and specialists work in dynamic environments with many conflicting demands on their time. Planning is complicated by the need to coordinate their own tasks with those of many landscape design, architecture, engineering, landscaping, urban planning, grounds maintenance, nursery and greenhouse professionals. They must be able to work on several projects at the same time and manage priorities. Changes in landscape designs or weather conditions, delays in the delivery of organic or inorganic materials, staffing shortages, pressures from supervisors or clients, equipment breakdowns and other emergencies force them to frequently reorganize job tasks. Senior landscape and horticultural technicians and specialists play a central role in organizing, planning, scheduling and monitoring the activities of employees and contractors who construct or maintain landscaped environments. (3)

Decide which tasks to assign to which employees. Consider each individual's skills, experience, attitude and ability to meet deadlines. (2)

Choose trees, shrubs and plants to recommend to clients. Take into consideration factors such as the terrain, soil conditions, sun exposures and clients' preferences and budgets. (2)

Decide to bid on particular landscape design projects. Review invitations to tender to determine whether the organization has the time and skills sets needed to write solid submissions, be competitive and eventually bring the proposed projects to fruition. Consult supervisors and co-workers to gather their input. (3)

Recommend and may select contractors for the construction or maintenance of gardens, parks, golf courses and other landscaped environments. Review various tenders and determine which contractors offer the best prices and most feasible work plans. Because most landscaping and horticultural work is seasonal, plans may be delayed for a whole year and considerable time and money lost if contractors fail to perform as expected. (3)

Select fertilizers, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides and other chemicals to use. Consider factors such as the health and condition of trees, shrubs, plants and turf. Review information found in Material Safety Data Sheets relating to the ingredients, health hazards, handling, storage, disposal and other characteristics of chemical products. If the wrong product is used, it can cause significant environmental damage and waste money. (4)

Encounter bad weather which prevents landscaping operations from proceeding. Advise supervisors or clients and make schedule changes for the crews. (1)

Local suppliers cannot be located for plants and trees of the types specified in contracts. The situation is further complicated if clients will not accept substitutes. In such instances, contact distant suppliers until plants and trees are located and arrange for the fastest possible delivery. (2)

Crews encounter unexpected difficulties such as the discovery of big boulders and tree stumps that are hard to remove. If project deadlines cannot be met, meet with supervisors or clients to outline the difficulties and provide estimates of the additional time and resources required. (2)

Face staffing shortages on particular days. Contact casual and on-call employees to check their availabilities. If enough replacement workers cannot be found, revise schedules and work later than originally planned. Remaining work may have to be rescheduled. (2)

Landscape designs you created exceed clients' budgets. Meet with clients to discuss whether additional funds will be made available to cover the added costs. If not, modify the designs to reduce costs. For example, elect to reduce the number of trees planted. (3)

Assess the health and conditions of trees, shrubs, plants and lawns. Complete visual examinations, analyse foliages and consider factors such as the shape of the trees and the presence of discoloured, peeling, splitting or cracking bark and stunted growth. Also check coloured pictures of varied types of diseases and take into account the characteristic appearance of these diseases at various stages in their life cycles. (2)

Evaluate the quality of work done by contractors and employees who install and maintain landscaped environments. Verify that specified tasks have been performed, specified inorganic and organic materials and equipment operating procedures have been used, and timeframes, landscape design plans, codes and regulations have been respected. (2)

Assess the suitability of candidates applying for seasonal jobs in horticulture and landscaping. Review résumés to identify relevant work histories and educational achievements, interview potential candidates and analyse qualifications using predetermined guidelines. (2)

Assess the effectiveness of various techniques and approaches for the treatment of damaged or diseased trees, shrubs, plants or turf. Design and conduct experiments. Define variables to be investigated, such as outside temperatures, rainfalls, soil acidity, pests and previous treatments. Collect data on these interrelated variables, analyse results and offer opinions and recommendations. (3)<|endoftext|>Shuttermag: The Photographer's Gathering Spothttp://www.shuttermag.com

The current system needs work. As mentioned, the waiting time is too long, nobody wants to be sitting around for half an hour for a mechanic to show up.
I definitely appreciate that not everything needs to be instant, but to make this problem worse, it tells us how many mechanics are online - but what people don't know is that not all of them are allowed/trained to go out. This just makes it seem like the 10+ mechanics online are just ignoring us.
Having a shop item would solve this. Do I think this is always going to be needed? No. But I certainly think for now, and for a long time it's been needed.

As a friendly pointer, might I suggest you take these reports a little more seriously. You have broken a rule and your attitude suggests to me that you do not care.
Thanks to all involved, I see no reason to respond further.

You weren't gone that long... so, I won't comment on that.
You could've just DM'd me one more time to let me know you couldn't come back but instead kept me waiting for a while.
Don't really know what to say. I'd be happy with just a 'verbal' warning but up to staff.

Unix time stamp from HUD: 1573153936
Your characters name: Kai DeVito
Other player(s) involved: N/A
Specific rule(s) broken:
8. Non-Roleplay (NRP)
Actions that are unrealistic or promote poor quality roleplay are considered as non-roleplay.
Examples of actions that are considered as non-roleplay:
• Cop Baiting - Provoking a reaction from emergency services without a realistic reason.
• Mercy Killing - Asking to be killed by a friend (Killing a friend falls under deathmatching).
• Unrealistic stunt jumping or the use of an expensive vehicle to ram into other vehicles.
• Spawning a scripted work vehicle and using it for crimes or submerging any vehicle in water.
• Swimming in water for an unrealistic amount of time or without a destination during a chase.
Players who disconnect during roleplay must reconnect and inform other parties in order to resume roleplay. If you are unable to reconnect it may be excused after providing proof.
In a situation where a player gets away from an incident where they're being chased/pursued, they must wait 15 minutes before they can logout. Players should not instigate roleplay situations if they do not have time to play it through.
Players who ignore answering roleplay commands directed at them, e.g. /do.
In a situation where a player’s game crashes or the player is kicked from the server, they should be allowed to have the same advantages as they have had before their leave.
How did the player break the rule(s)?
The player timed out from in game, and initially made no attempt to alert me to him crashing. The player had earlier tried to add me on Discord to provide a video of whether the door was open on his screen or not. I gave him some time to let me know, however he did not and so I PM'd him after there was also no response in the ECRP General Chat.
He responded saying that his game had crashed, however he seemingly made no attempt to come back, and then stopped responded altogether, ignoring my messages. I waited a full 35-40 minutes as he had previously said he would return and nothing came of it.
Evidence of rule breach:
My video contains staff chat, I shall DM whoever is handling this.

My suggestion, in my opinion, makes this whole system much much better.
It allows people to leave messages without having to know the owner.
As mentioned in OP - its better to not necessarily declare the owner too easily.

Currently, if you're trying to get in touch or leave a message for an owner of a house, its impossible if you dont know who it is.
Having a way you can leave a message where they are alerted in chat (similar to ticket system maybe) would be extremely beneficial to the server, property owners, buyers as well as friends. You'd get this notification as you enter your home, that way there is no metagaming and may encourage people to check their home and mail more often.
This would certainly help with people trying to purchase houses or any other needs of contact.
Theres an argument for further information, however I dont think there should be names, phone numbers or emails so that owners can remain anonymous.

Personally, I prefer the way name changes are now. I do not believe it should return to the in game option it had before, as this often promotes a careless attitude towards changing names.
I can agree that there are plenty of reasons to change it, but unfortunately if its really worth it, then using credits is worth it.
If you live in a country that does not have the ability to perform international transactions, that's unfortunate. It's a shame but that should not restrict the progression of the server or these types of decisions. This new system, in my opinion, improves the server and should remain. I am not totally familiar with the options you may have, but you could attempt to get someone to gift you credits.
Either way, -1.

Other player(s) involved: ID 2, 91 and 110 - I think they are all 'victims'. Police later showed up after one of them shot at 31 to defend themselves.
Specific rule(s) broken:
14. Deathmatch (DM)
Deathmatching is the act of attacking a player or their property without a proper roleplay reason.
Examples of valid reasons to attack another player:
• If they attempt to arrest or hurt you, an ally, or damage your property.
• If they report you to the police for a serious crime.
• If they are not in compliance with demands, attempt to escape, or call other players for help in a situation where they are required to display fear under fear roleplay rules.
A player cannot kill their victim if the victim is in compliance with the demands.
A player must allow their victim enough time to comply with the demands.
If a player informs you that your VOIP isn’t working, you must either fix your VOIP using appropriate commands or use text to deliver your demand(s).
Vehicles cannot be used to attack another player more than once including a failed attempt.
Attacking another player with no engagement in roleplay is not allowed.
Killing a player that has obeyed all orders and demands during a roleplay situation is allowed, with roleplay, only within 3 hours of:﻿
Severe hostile or criminal action is taken against you, e.g. someone is robbing you at gunpoint. (Excluding police aiming a gun at you.)
Someone is attempting to take your life.﻿
Someone is attempting to take the life of your close friend or ally, or if you have witnessed it happen.
You must explain your reason to kill to the player IC and have OOC evidence proving your reason.
How did the player break the rule(s)?
Player repeatedly used his vehicle to ram the players involved. He made multiple attempts to ram, drive away and drive back.
Evidence of rule breach:
I will need to provide this to Staff as it includes staff chat and so on. Apologies in advance for background noise (Netflix on 2nd monitor). There's also a slight break in the video as the first part is Shadowplay of last few minutes, then continued on live recording.

Budget is flexible and purely dependant on the property you are selling.
I am most likely only interested in a house, not an apartment. Preferably with at least one garage.
Feel free to contact me by phone too at: #3724977

As said above, you can't set multiple people with the same one.
Whilst I could see the argument for allowing multiple people with the names, I also see this problematic in terms of immersion when you get confused between people just based on their names, even though in character you would recognise them by more than just a hovering name<|endoftext|>Alterations in cellular calcium handling as a result of systemic calcium deficiency in the developing chick embryo: II. Ventricular myocytes.
We have previously shown that cardiovascular anomalies, such as hypertension and tachycardia, develop in Ca(2+)-deficient, shell-less (SL) chick embryos cultured ex ovo, accompanied by elevated circulating catecholamines and higher alpha-adrenergic sensitivity of cardiovascular functions. Results described in the preceding work, using erythrocytes as an experimental system, show that cellular Ca2+ handling properties are also altered as a result of long-term calcium deficiency. To examine the relevance of these findings to cells of the cardiovasculature, we have analyzed and compared the Ca2+ handling characteristics of the heart cells of SL and normal (NL) embryos. For this study, isolated and cultured ventricular myocytes of SL and NL embryos were loaded with Fura-2 via transient membrane damage with glass beads. Compared to Fura-2/AM, bead loading yielded similar values and kinetic profiles of [Ca2+]i-dependent differential fluorescence and, in addition, did not affect cell viability and beating activity. The Fura-2 loaded ventricular myocytes were washed in Ca(2+)-free buffer and then analyzed by ratiometric fluorescence (350 nm/380 nm) microscopy for kinetic changes in [Ca2+]i (R350/380 values) as a function of [Ca2+]o and adrenergic modifiers. At 0.5 and 1.0 mM [Ca2+]o, SL cells showed significantly higher [Ca2+]i, higher beating rates, and faster rate of increase in [Ca2+]i compared to NL cells. At higher [Ca2+]o (3.5 mM), there was no significant difference in [Ca2+]i and beating rate between NL and SL cells. Treatment with norepinephrine (NE; 0.01-1 microM) at 1 mM [Ca2+]o substantially increased [Ca2+]i in both NL and SL cells. In the former, the NE effect was completely inhibited by beta-blockade (1 microM propranolol). In contrast, in SL cells, NE remained effective after beta-blockade, and combined alpha-blockade (1 microM prazosin) and beta-blockade was needed to inhibit completely the NE effect. In both NL and SL cells, treatment with NE substantially increased beating rates in a similar manner. Taken together, these findings suggest that Ca2+ handling and adrenergic regulation of the heart cells are significantly altered in the SL embryos, and that these alterations may be related to the development of impaired cardiovascular functions resulting from systemic Ca2+ deficiency.<|endoftext|>Jeff Ruby Culinary Entertainment

Fort Thomas Visioning Presented To Council

Joey Hood and Chris Manning discuss the results from the first three stakeholder visioning meetings that will lead to a comprehensive plan for the city of Fort Thomas. FTM file.

It's been over a year since Mayor Eric Haas led a whiteboard session in the Centennial Room on the third floor at The City Building. That session led to ideas like a skate park, zip line, roundabouts and a city-wide yard sale in Fort Thomas.

When the discussion started lending itself to broader topics, like "making more use of The Mess Hall" and "Midway District accessibility," Haas knew he needed a different approach.

"We thought we had some really good ideas and knew we needed to expand on them," he said. "We have real talent in this city to tap into so that's what we did."

Haas and council authorized the city to contract Fort Thomas residents, Chris Manning of Human Nature, Inc and Tom Fernandez of SHP Leading Design to help lead that new visioning process that will ultimately lead to a new comprehensive plan for the city of Fort Thomas.

"It doesn't have anything to do with spending or saving money," said Haas. "It doesn’t have anything to do with money, it’s about progress. We have moved passed whether or not we should stand pat or progress. I think we are all on board that we need to continue to move the city forward.”

FTM file.

Manning led three visioning meetings, two in October and one in November, with three separate city groups: city council, city staff and invited city stakeholders.

"The intent of that work was to create a foundation for building the next comprehensive plan update, park and recreation plan and the city's first comprehensive pedestrian and bicycle plan," said Manning. "We didn’t dive into too much detail in these meetings on purpose. Each one of these topics will take on a life of their own. So this is a framework."
The groups first looked at the population growth of Fort Thomas, originally named the District of the Highlands, and first incorporated on February 27 1867.

There are four distinct chapters in the city's history, which are defined by clear changes in character of the city, population and density of the community. From 1870 to the early 1970s's population growth remained steady as there was room to grow. Since the 1970's the population of Fort Thomas has remained stable with approximately 16,000 residents.

"We had some healthy discussion on whether or not that (population) number should be pushed up or not," said Manning. "It was decidedly evident that 16,500 was a comfortable number. But this exercise allowed us to study those moments in time and will help guide us when building a robust vision for the future."
In terms of density, greenspace was a buzzword heard often through the stakeholders meetings. According to the last General Services Annual Report, new construction for residential units are at a 10-year high when 34 new homes, mostly in the Villagrande subdivision, were constructed.

That said, greenspace was a commodity that stakeholders saw as something that should be preserved.

Asset mapping was a tool used during the three meetings to identify the community assets and identify ways of connecting the assets to find areas of future opportunities.

Manning said to help facilitate the dialogue, a series of base maps were created to highlight what the city's greatest assets were by utilizing a live mapping feature.

For example, on the south end of town near the Midway Business District, there are many assets that don't necessarily connect or synergize with one another: the reservoir, VA Hospital, Tower Park and Midway Businesses are all in the same area, but don't have an easy way to connect.

"That's what we spent most of the time doing, was asset mapping. What are the significant opportunity areas for our future? That's what we tried to summarize," he said. "I was inspired by leadership that came from city staff in terms of wanting the city building to be an example of governance and services."

Manning mentioned three over-arching takeaways:
1) To continue the momentum and quest for continual self-improvement
2) Strengthen the city's assets and connectivity
3) Stay true to who we are.

Manning said a lot of the stakeholder input involved around connectivity and so much dialogue that involved pedestrian and bicycle connectivity that he advised the city to create its first Comprehensive Pedestrian and Bicycle Plan.

"There was so much energy toward linking these assets and it became clear there was a large focus on a more robust trail network. It was such a strong voice that if it gets folded into a comprehensive plan it sort of gets lost."Trails and a stronger pedestrian network were common themes at each of the stakeholders meetings. The direct impact it has on the safety and health of our community it became clear that it was time to develop the city's first comprehensive pedestrian and bicycle plan."
Manning said the plan would focus on community engagement after assessing current conditions and needs before implementing of bicycles and pedestrian elements in the statewide transportation plans.

"Collaboration with our neighbors becomes very important. Riverfront Commons in Dayton or working with the hospital and city of Newport, Southgate, or Highland Heights and at our edges. You start talking about transportation, then you start talking about having partnerships with Kentucky Transportation Cabinet or OKI."
A road diet to take away a lane of Grand Avenue was also discussed and had favorable feedback.More input regarding connectivity:
- Trail connection to the Ohio River through city parcels and Duke Energy easements near Dayton
- Trail connection through Highland Park for students and residents
- Connecting Highlands High and Middle School to Ohio River through the hillside greenbelt
- Creating a new park entry to Highland Park behind the Fort Thomas Swim Club
- Creating a pedestrian connection behind the Central Business District
- Connecting Tower Park to the Ohio River
- Connecting the Midway District to the Ohio River
- Connecting the Midway District to neighborhood pockets
- Connecting the potential Alexandria Pike District with the Ohio River

The next step will be to get more input to start to hone in on some of these over-arching themes with more stakeholders.<|endoftext|>// Copyright (c) by respective owners including Yahoo!, Microsoft, and

Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) on Friday moved to seek federal backing for an $800 million rapid-transit bus system to connect the state’s surging population and technology corridor along Interstate 270 to the Metro system.

As envisioned, the route would extend the current end of the Red Line in Shady Grove for 15 miles, into northwest Montgomery County and almost halfway to Frederick. Buses would operate in a dedicated new lane, separated from existing traffic, and connect federal facilities, corporate headquarters and residential town centers from just outside the beltway to just north of Germantown.

O’Malley’s decision all but ends years of debate about whether the so-called Corridor Cities Transitway, or CCT, should be operated by bus or more expensive light rail. Even in its more frugal form, however, the route adds a third major Maryland transit project to already stiff competition for federal transportation dollars.

The announcement also highlights anew Maryland’s nearly bankrupt transportation trust fund. O’Malley this year failed to persuade lawmakers to approve a gasoline sales tax to replenish the account. Without some form of new revenue, Maryland in coming years will not be able to afford even one of its three major transit plans. A proposed Purple Line connecting Montgomery and Prince George’s and a planned light-rail line in Baltimore would each cost roughly $2 billion.

“This is a very first step,” Maryland Transportation Secretary Beverley K. Swaim-Staley said of the bus route. “It is another need that we have now identified, and we will have to figure out how in the future to pay for it.”

Swaim-Staley, who recently announced she is leaving her post, said she is nonetheless confident that the bus line stands a good chance to win federal backing, in part because it will be less complicated than a rail project, and would be built mostly along roads where the state already owns right-of-way.

According to Friday’s announcement, the state will submit the project to the Federal Transit Administration under its New Starts Program this summer. If approved, the state could begin preliminary engineering in roughly a year, Swaim-Staley said.

Depending on funding, construction could begin in 2018 and the line could be in service by 2020.

Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett and county council members who early this year reversed course and endorsed the bus line, praised the state’s decision Friday, saying construction as soon as possible will be critical to the county’s planned growth.

The county cannot proceed with its long-term plans to develop an area in Gaithersburg for science research, known as the Great Seneca Science Corridor, without the bus line because much of the approved denser zoning for the area is dependent on having access to public transportation.

If built, the line would be Maryland’s first rapid-transit bus line. State officials offered no estimate Friday of how much tickets to ride the line might cost.<|endoftext|>Pit bulls are perhaps the most misunderstood dog in America, and one pit bull and her owner are on a mission to change that.

The public perception continues to be that pit bulls are innately aggressive killers — a stereotype that has driven cities to enact bans against owning or breeding them, and some shelters to euthanize abandoned pit bulls rather than allow adoptions. Many experts and owners insist society has the wrong idea about the breed, which is why Maura Porter and her pit bull, Blueberry, are fighting to change people's minds. Their grassroots effort, documented on Facebook, has grown to 20,000 followers and counting as people from all over the world join their mission to shatter the stigma against pit bulls.

Meet Blueberry.

Maura Porter and Blueberry Maura Porter

Porter never spent much time around pit bulls before she started volunteering at the Milton Animal League. The shelter sits on the edge of the Massachusetts Blue Hills, a large park space in the center of Boston where a lot of dogs are abandoned, many of which are pit bulls.

While volunteering, Porter decided she wanted to adopt one of the animals. She had a friend, dying from cancer, who was visited by therapy dogs as he prepared to say goodbye. When he passed, Porter and her husband decided they wanted to do something to help other patients like him. Porter brought home a number of dogs in order to learn their temperaments before choosing one that few people might: a 7-year-old pit bull named Blueberry.

Maura Porter

Few pit bulls are lucky enough to have an owner like Porter. About 3.9 million dogs go through animal shelters in a given year, and a majority of them are pit bulls — even though the breed makes up a small (if uncertain) percentage of the general dog population in the U.S. Up to 93% of these sheltered pit bulls are euthanized before ever being put up for adoption. More than 800 cities have restrictions or outright bans on them. In part because of the negative stereotypes about pit bulls, people don't want them, people are afraid of them — and innocent dogs suffer.

All this despite the fact that the American Temperament Test Society, which measures dogs' dispositions, finds that pit bulls have some of the best attitudes of any breed. That means they show fewer aggressive or panic-avoidant behaviors than a golden retriever or collie.

The ASPCA says it's not pit bulls' innate nature so much as their bad reputation that attracts unscrupulous owners who want to turn these dogs into something they're not — mainly, canine gladiators. That, in turn, fuels the stereotype.

Maura Porter

Blueberry's struggle.

After a series of certification tests and behavioral trainings for Blueberry, Porter and her husband applied for her to visit at a therapy center outside of Boston that worked with mentally delayed adults. She was rejected; staff said they didn't want a pit bull in their program.

"I was like, you would never want anyone to judge your students based on how they look, but you're doing that to my dog," Porter said. "You are looking at her and saying based on her breed, she's incapable of [visiting with your students]."

"All I needed was to get in the door, I knew if they met her they would love her," Porter said.

Eventually, Blueberry found a place with Dog B.O.N.E.S., a service that provides therapy dogs to those in need.

And now, Porter and Blueberry are having a transformational impact. Every week, they visit with people who have terminal illnesses and severe disabilities, who are at the end of their lives or are just going through rehab. In total, Blueberry has visited with hundreds of people undergoing difficult moments in their own lives. Porter has been documenting the visits on Facebook, and now calls Blueberry the "pit bull therapy dog changing minds one visit at a time."

Her Facebook page is filled with accounts like this:

We went to the upstairs common area [of the rehab hospital]. A woman was visiting with her husband. She looked up and saw Blueberry ... and asked what kind of dog she was. She recoiled in fear when I said 'pit bull'. Then she stuttered, "I never thought that they could do this — never thought they were nice — that I would pet one, ever. A pit bull, oh my a pit bull." Then she became Blueberry's PR agent, telling every person who entered the area that Blueberry was a "pit bull and amazing". When her adult granddaughter showed up she gave her the same line and the granddaughter said, "They are good dogs, Gram. I'm glad you finally get to see that."

Maura Porter

Blueberry is now in high demand. In the aftermath of the Boston marathon bombing, Blueberry visited a number of local businesses when they finally re-opened to play with people and help ease their fears and settle back into regular life.

"[Blueberry] definitely makes an impact when she's there," Porter said. "She loves people."

Maura Porter

It's time to end the stereotype.

Porter is on a mission to change the way America thinks about pit bulls. She wants more people to meet Blueberry, so she can help change their minds about the breed.

Meanwhile, their Facebook following continues to grow, as people rethink what pit bulls are really like. What began as 150 extended family and friends following along has grown into a community of 20,395 and counting, representing 35 countries around the world.

"If people are willing to put aside any biases they have," Porter said, "they would open up their whole mind to [not] judging anybody, whether human or animal ... based on how they look."

Blueberry's out spreading the word, one sloppy kiss at a time.<|endoftext|> -1241, 1 in decreasing order.

Thomas Müller’s thunderous equaliser ensured the heavyweight friendly showdown between Germany and Spain finished all-square in Dusseldorf.

Rodrigo gave Spain an early lead in the battle between the last two World Cup winners, but Müller levelled things up before half-time with an unstoppable 25-yard shot.

Both teams had chances to win the game, with Germany defender Mats Hummels hitting the crossbar and opposing goalkeepers David de Gea and Marc-André ter Stegen cementing their reputations as two of the best stoppers on the planet, but no more goals were forthcoming as the match finished 1-1.

Spain travelled to Germany unbeaten in 16 games since Julen Lopetegui took the reins after Euro 2016, but Friday’s clash at a sold-out Esprit Arena represented arguably their biggest test of that run.

With that in mind, Lopetegui named a strong side - as did Germany counterpart Joachim Löw - which included a 150th international appearance for Sergio Ramos.

And the 2010 World Cup winners could hardly have made a better start against the reigning world champions, taking the lead inside six minutes.

Andres Iniesta picked out Rodrigo’s run in behind Hummels with an inch-perfect pass into the box, and the Valencia forward fired a rising first-time shot past Ter Stegen.

That was just the start Spain would have been hoping for, but Germany - also unbeaten since the European Championships in a run of 21 matches - rallied and went close through Jonas Hector and Timo Werner before Müller drew them level 10 minutes before the break with a stunning strike.

Mesut Özil, Hector, Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira were all involved before the ball was fed to Müller and the Bayern Munich forward took one touch before unleashing an unstoppable shot into the top corner of De Gea’s net.

De Gea had no chance to save that, but Germany found the Manchester United keeper unbeatable otherwise.

He was called into action just moments after the restart to brilliantly turn away Julian Draxler’s 25-yard piledriver and then produced another impressive stop to deny İlkay Gündoğan.

In between those efforts Germany keeper Ter Stegen showed what he can do with a fine save from Isco.

The hosts continued to pose the greater goalthreat,and Werner went close again before Hummels sent a 65th-minute header crashing against the crossbar from Kroos’s cross.

Spain substitute Diego Costa had chance to snatch a late winner but he could not convert and the two countries - who could meet again in the World Cup semi-finals - ended up sharing the honours.<|endoftext|>Background {#Sec1}
==========

The gliding Gram-negative Myxobacteria, belonging to the delta division of Proteobacteria, are well known for social motility in space and time. They are known to swarm, predate, have multicellular differentiation, grow millimeter-size spore-filled fruiting bodies, and have large genomes of more than 9 Mb in size \[[@CR1]--[@CR4]\]. The genus *Myxococcus*, especially *M. xanthus* DK1622 represents as a model strain among the myxobacteria since its life-cycle can be investigated under laboratory conditions. Furthermore, *M. xanthus* DK1622 can be used as a heterologous expression host to express secondary metabolite gene clusters from other difficult-to-handle myxobacteria or marine myxobacteria for the production of metabolites, e.g. epothilone, haliangicin, disorazol, etc. \[[@CR5]--[@CR8]\]., which can be scaled up by genetic modification of the genome. Currently, however, operation of the *M. xanthus* DK1622 genome in the laboratory is governed mainly by antibiotic resistance against kanamycin and tetracycline \[[@CR9], [@CR10]\].

Chloramphenicol (Cm) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, characterized by the presence of a nitrobenzene group containing nonionic chlorine, an amide linkage involving a derivative of dichloroacetic acid and a propanol moiety \[[@CR11]\]. It binds directly to the 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibits peptide bond formation by interacting with the peptidyl transferase center \[[@CR12]\]. There are three main mechanisms responsible for resistance to Cm:Cm acetyltransferases (CAT) encoded by *cat* genes \[[@CR11]\], Cm efflux pumps mediated by numerous kinds of transporters \[[@CR13]--[@CR16]\] and rRNA methylase \[[@CR17]\]. Some *cat* genes are inducible and expressed via translational attenuation, with Cm itself acting as an inducer \[[@CR18]\]. A Cm-resistant phenotype of *M. xanthus* FBt was derived and characterized from *M. xanthus* FB, in which Cm acetyltransferase activity was shown to be related to Cm resistance \[[@CR19]\]. The *cat* gene belonging to Cm acetyltransferase is often used as a Cm resistance marker in many organisms, as a genetic operation tool \[[@CR8], [@CR20]\].

Here, we compared the transcriptome of wild-type phenotype DK1622 with that of other phenotypes under the influence of Cm, to understand the mechanism by which DK1622 grows normally in the presence of Cm, and to develop an antibiotic selection tool. Here, a total of 297 genes were identified to be highly increased in our Cm resistant phenotype (Cm5_36h). Gene knockouts and comparative growth analysis indicated that MXAN_2566 was the main player involved in Cm resistance; a gene encoding a protein that pumped Cm outside the cell. In gene-knockout strain DK-2566, a method to integrate gene fragments into the genome via homologous recombination using Cm selection, with our constructed Cm marker plasmid was developed successfully. It add to a growing toolkit for molecular studies in *M. xanthus* and will be useful for the elucidation of patterns in microbial cell factories.

*M. xanthus* DK1622 grows normally in CTT + Cm medium after induction {#Sec3}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, the *cat* gene was introduced into the genome of *M. xanthus* via either transposition or site-directed insertion (Mx8) \[[@CR8]\]. Subsequently, the *cat* gene was used as a marker, flanked by two loxP sites, to indicate the cut efficiency by Cre recombinase in *M. xanthus* DK1622 \[[@CR21]\] in our lab (which was successful). When we tried to integrate homologous arm into chromosome by Cm screening, we could not obtain the correct mutant strains from Cm resistant strains. Hence, we studied Cm-induced growth of DK1622 in order to construct a sensitive strain for chassis construction and the development of genetic operation tools. To determine the effect of Cm on growth, DK1622 cells at the mid-exponential phase and later-exponential phase were used as seed broths, and diluted to fresh CTT liquid medium supplemented with Cm. At these two time points, cells were white (36 h of incubation; OD 600 was about 2.3) and were observed to become yellow later (44 h of incubation; OD 600 was about 4.1). These cells were marked as DK1622-36 white or DK1622-44h yellow (Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"}b), respectively.Fig. 1Growth curves of *M. xanthus* DK1622 in CTT liquid medium with or without Cm addition. **a** Growth curves of *M. xanthus* DK1622 in CTT liquid medium without Cm addition. **b** Sensitivity of *M. xanthus* DK1622 cultivated from different growth stage with Cm addition (10 μg/ml). Cells from exponentially growing culture in the absence of Cm, at different time points where cells stay white or become yellow, were diluted to OD 600 of 0.05 in CTT medium, marked in CTT-white or CTT-yellow. Cell density was monitored after incubation at 30 °C for 12 h. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Error bars indicate standard deviations

Differently from the DK1622 wild type, which only required 48 h to reach the stationary phase at 30 °C in CTT liquid medium (Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"}a), DK1622-36 white in CTT + Cm liquid medium required 6-days to enter the exponential phase through a dormant stage. DK1622-44 yellow (in CTT + Cm liquid medium) had spent 8-days in dormancy, which is longer than DK1622-36 white. During the log phase, cells remained yellow (Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"}b). In the subsequent experiment, DK1622-36 white was used with CTT + Cm liquid medium to obtain the Cm5_36h phenotype.

To investigate whether the Cm5_36h phenotype can grow normally in CTT + Cm, we measured the generation time of phenotype Cm5_36h. Cm5_36h of *M. xanthus* grew with a mean generation time of 5.3 h. In the absence of Cm, the mean generation time of strain DK1622 was 5.1 h. Hence, there was no significant difference in the mean generation time of Cm5_36h.

To evaluate Cm resistance stability in CTT liquid medium (without Cm addition), we performed a loss frequency test on CTT agar plates with no Cm. After the transfer of Cm5_36h cells to fresh medium lacking the antibiotic, cells were observed to grow as normal. However, it was found that the efficiency of growth on Cm agar dropped sharply after 5 h (approximately one generation) (Additional file [1](#MOESM1){ref-type="media"}: Fig. S1). The drop reflected the numbers of Cm-resistant cells. When phenotype Cm5_36h was grown in CTT + Cm liquid medium spread on CTT + Cm agar, the number of colony-forming units did not change, compared to wild type DK1622 in CTT medium. Besides the Cm5_36h and DK1622 wild phenotype at the mid-exponential stage in CTT liquid medium (the sample was abbreviated NDK), DK1622 induced by CTT + Cm at 8 h (in this early dormancy stage) was used to perform RNA sequencing, to avoid third-day dormancy, which may represent the spore-forming stage. The sample was abbreviated as Cm_8h.

Identification of expressed transcripts and expression level analysis in the *M. xanthus* transcriptome {#Sec4}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This characteristic is similar to that of *M. xanthus* FB~t~Cam~1~^r^, one of the spontaneous chloramphenicol-resistant isolates \[[@CR19]\], which was reported due to the activity of Cm acetyltransferase from cell-free extracts. To understand drug-resistance mechanisms and to develop a new antibiotic screening method via homologous integration into chromosomes, genes correlated to the drug resistance were identified and a sensitive strain for chassis development was constructed. For each samples, 5,400,651 to 10,042,311 raw reads were generated. After removing adapter and ploy-N containing reads as well as low quality reads from raw data, 3,924,175 to 9,584,772 clean reads and total 7350 transcripts were obtained from the three samples (Additional file [2](#MOESM2){ref-type="media"}: Fig. S2 and Additional file [3](#MOESM3){ref-type="media"}: Table S1). The clean transcripts were used for further analysis. The percentage of genes having different expression levels were listed in Additional file [4](#MOESM4){ref-type="media"}: Table S2. Among 7348 predicted protein coding genes in the reference genome, 7094 (95.3% of the total genes, RPKM ≥ 15), 7257 (98.7% of the total genes, RPKM ≥ 15) and 7094 (96.5% of the total genes, RPKM ≥ 15) genes were detected in control, Cm_8h and Cm5_36h conditions, respectively (Additional file [4](#MOESM4){ref-type="media"}: Table S2). As can be seen from Additional file [5](#MOESM5){ref-type="media"}: Fig. S3 and Additional file [6](#MOESM6){ref-type="media"}: Fig. S4, the distribution of genes having different expression levels in Cm5_36h was similar to that of NDK before Cm-treatment. However, after treatment of the dormant strain cm8h, the number of genes at high expression levels was higher than in Cm5_36h, which indicated a strong response of genes to Cm treatment. Markedly, the percentage of FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped) \> 60 is more than 55%, covering 4092 transcribed genes (Additional file [4](#MOESM4){ref-type="media"}: Table S2). The percentages of reads mapped to the reference genome in different samples were shown in Additional file [7](#MOESM7){ref-type="media"}: Table S3.

Chromosomal distributions of the reads in three samples were shown in Additional file [8](#MOESM8){ref-type="media"}: Fig. S5. The density of Cm5_36h reads in the chromosome region was similar to that of NDK, showing that regions encoding secondary biosynthetic gene clusters were actively transcribed (Fig. [2](#Fig2){ref-type="fig"}). Conversely in Cm_8h, such regions were not actively transcribed (Additional file [8](#MOESM8){ref-type="media"}: Fig. S5).

![Cluster analysis of differentially expressed genes](12934_2019_1172_Fig2_HTML){#Fig2}

Furthermore, the distribution of reads mapped to genomic regions were also investigated according gene structure, sequence coding for amino acids in protein (CDS) and intergenic regions. More than 80% of bases were mapped to CDS regions in NDK and Cm5_36h samples, and \< 70% of bases were mapped to CDS regions in Cm_8h samples, which indicated that sample Cm_8h was experiencing an adapted period of the dormant phase (Additional file [5](#MOESM5){ref-type="media"}: Fig. S3).

Identification of differentially expressed genes between different samples {#Sec5}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To understand the mechanism of Cm resistance, differentially expressed genes (DEG) between different samples were analyzed by transcriptome studies. Comparison of the transcription levels of unigenes between Cm resistant Cm5_36h and Cm susceptible NDK revealed 481 DEGs, including 297 upregulated genes and 184 downregulated genes (Additional file [9](#MOESM9){ref-type="media"}: Fig. S6A). Comparison of Cm_8h and NDK identified 1920 DEGs, which included 625 upregulated and 1295 downregulated (Additional file [9](#MOESM9){ref-type="media"}: Fig. S6C) genes. Comparison of Cm5_36h to Cm_8h displayed 1970 DEGs, of which 1300 were upregulated and 670 downregulated (Additional file [9](#MOESM9){ref-type="media"}: Fig. S6B). Shown in a Venn diagram, a total of 167 DEGs were downregulated and 101 DEGs were upregulated in Cm5_36h and Cm_8h, in which 5 DEGs were upregulated in Cm5_36h, Cm_8h and Cm5_36h vs Cm_8h (Additional file [10](#MOESM10){ref-type="media"}: Fig. S7B). The total number of DEGs was also shown in a Venn diagram (Additional file [10](#MOESM10){ref-type="media"}: Fig. S7A).

Functional distribution of differentially expressed genes {#Sec6}
---------------------------------------------------------

According to GO (Gene ontology) categories, a comparison has been made representing the 30 major functional groups significantly upregulated in Cm5_36h vs Cm_8h (Fig. [3](#Fig3){ref-type="fig"}a). In Cm_8h vs NDK, there was only one group, DNA recombination, which was significantly upregulated, indicating that the cell was activated to accept foreign genes, such as those that confer antibiotic resistance (Fig. [3](#Fig3){ref-type="fig"}b). In Cm5_36h vs NDK, DE genes were also categorized into 30 major functional groups. However, no group was significantly upregulated (Fig. [3](#Fig3){ref-type="fig"}c). On the contrary, all of the 30 major functional groups were significantly upregulated in Cm5_36h vs Cm_8h. Although there were no significant differences in GO function for up-regulation in Cm5_36h vs NDK, we attempted to analyze the 30 top functional groups to elucidate an antibiotic resistance mechanism and related functional groups induced by the addition of Cm. These 30 top functional groups in Cm5_36h vs NDK mainly included transferase-related activity, drug-related transport and fatty-acid-related processes. The upregulated and downregulated groups in these top 30 major functional groups are listed in Additional file [11](#MOESM11){ref-type="media"}: Fig. S8. KEGG pathway enrichment in phenotype Cm5_36h was also analyzed, and beta-lactam resistance as well as the degradation of aromatic compounds which are possibly related to Cm resistance and degradation were observed (Fig. [4](#Fig4){ref-type="fig"}), suggesting multiple-drug resistance mechanisms might play an important role of Cm resistance.Fig. 3Comparison of functional annotations between different samples. **a** Comparable group: Cm5-36 and NDK; **b** comparable group: Cm_8h and NDK; **c** comparable group: Cm5_36h and Cm_8h. The green bars represent biological processes; orange bars represent cellular components; purple bars represent molecular functions Fig. 4KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs between Cm5_36h and NDK Y-axis label represents the distinct KEGG pathways, and X-axis label represents rich factor (rich factor = amount of DEGs in the pathway/amount of all genes in background gene set). The colors of the dots represent the Q-values of enrichment. Red color indicates high enrichment, while blue color indicates low enrichment. Pathway terms were sorted by Q-value in ascending order; and were marked in bold and underlined when Q-value \< 0.05. The sizes of the dots represent the gene number of enrichments

Some acetyltransferases were differentially expressed upon Cm induction {#Sec7}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some *M. xanthus* species can be induced to become Cm-resistant due to the existence of Cm acetyltransferase \[[@CR19]\]. Among the 625 upregulated DEGs in Cm_8h vs NDK, seven genes (MXAN_0841, MXAN_1079, MXAN_1237, MXAN_2227, MXAN_3231, MXAN_4520, and MXAN_5479) encoding enzymes were found which might be involved in conferring Cm specific acetyltransferase activity. Similarly, among the 135 upregulated DEGs in the Cm5_36h vs NDK, six similar genes (MXAN_0841, TMXAN_1079, MXAN_1237, MXAN_4417, MXAN_6182 and MXAN_6984) were also found (Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type="table"}).Table 1differentially expressed genes related with acetyltransferase in Cm_8h and Cm5_36hGene nameDescriptionlog~2~FoldChangePhenotype nameMXAN_0841Glycine acetyltransferase1.96Cm5_36h2.48Cm_8hMXAN_1079*N*-Acetyltransferase1.58Cm5_36h2.58Cm_8hMXAN_1237*N*-Acetyltransferase1.79Cm5_36h1.47Cm_8hMXAN_4417*N*-Acetyltransferase1.35Cm5_36hMXAN_6182*N*-Acetyltransferase1.18Cm5_36hMXAN_6984*N*-Acetyltransferase1.82Cm5_36hMXAN_2227*N*-Acetyltransferase1.04Cm_8hMXAN_3231*N*-Acetyltransferase1.02Cm_8hMXAN_4520*N*-Acetyltransferase1.20Cm_8hMXAN_5479Sugar *O*-acetyltransferase1.38Cm_8h

According to predictions for ARDB antibiotics based on the Resistance Genes Database, MXAN_5479 was predicted to belong to group B of Cm acetyltransferases, which can inactivate chloramphenicol through the addition of an acetyl group. Before we performed this transcriptome sequencing, we predicted that MXAN_5479 might be involved in Cm resistance, and deleted the gene. However, the mutant strain did not present any differences compared with the wild type DK1622 (data not shown). Although the transcription level of MXAN_5479 was upregulated in cm8h vs NDK (log2FC, 1.38), it was not changed in Cm5_36h vs NDK.

Membrane-related proteins were upregulated in Cm induced culture {#Sec8}
----------------------------------------------------------------

In the Cm5_36h vs NDK, MXAN_90 and MXAN_91 were observed to be related to drug transmembrane transport, drug transport and responses to drugs (at the level of biological processes) in KEGG pathway analysis. They were also related to drug transmembrane transporter activity (at the level of molecular functions). These two genes were also observed to be upregulated in Cm_8h vs NDK. They belong to a group of RND transporters, which is one of five main kinds of transporter related to antibiotics resistance. This operon was identified to be highly upregulated upon Cm induction in cm8h vs NDK and Cm5_36h vs NDK. To investigate the possibility of other transporters, we listed the MFS transporter, ABC transporter, and MATE transporter which were up-regulated in Cm_8h vs NDK and in Cm5_36h vs NDK.

Markedly, among the DEGs in the Cm-resistant strain Cm5_36h compared to NDK, the MFS transporter (MXAN_2566) was found to be the most highly upregulated gene (log2FC, 5.60), which was annotated to be a Cm resistance gene (CmlA/FloR family chloramphenicol efflux MFS transporter). The MATE family transporter (MXAN_7022) was the second upregulated transporter (log2FC, 3.00) in Cm5_36h. However, among the DEGs in Cm_8h, the RND transporter (MXAN_0091) mentioned above was the most upregulated gene (log2FC, 4.65), and the MATE family transporter (MXAN_7022) was the second upregulated (log2FC, 3.92) (Table [2](#Tab2){ref-type="table"}).Table 2differentially expressed genes related with transporter in Cm_8h and Cm5_36hGene nameDescriptionlog~2~FoldChangePhenotype nameMXAN_2566MFS transporter5.60Cm5_36h1.42Cm_8hMXAN_7022MATE family transporter3.00Cm5_36h3.92Cm_8hMXAN_0091RND transporter2.32Cm5_36h4.65Cm_8hMXAN_0092RND transporter1.46Cm5_36h1.38Cm_8hMXAN_7119MATE family transporter1.12Cm5_36h1.01Cm_8hMXAN_1286ABC transporter1.57Cm5_36hMXAN_6403ABC transporter1.08Cm5_36hMXAN_0819Biopolymer transporter1.61Cm5_36h2.19Cm_8hMXAN_2948ABC transporter1.14Cm_8hMXAN_5963MFS transporter1.27Cm_8hMXAN_0274Biopolymer transporter1.14Cm_8hMXAN_3225ABC transporter1.04Cm_8hMXAN_3650ABC transporter1.13Cm_8hMXAN_3677MFS transporter1.12Cm_8hMXAN_4623ABC transporter3.18Cm_8hMXAN_4818ABC transporter1.01Cm_8hMXAN_4819ABC transporter1.07Cm_8hMXAN_5186Multidrug transporter1.13Cm_8h

MXAN_0091, MXAN_0092, MXAN_0819, MXAN_2566, MXAN_7022, MXAN_7119 were simultaneously upregulated in Cm_8h vs NDK and Cm5_36h vs NDK indicating that they are all related to the Cm resistance.

To further verify the RNA sequencing data, we investigated the transcription pattern of MXAN_2566 of DK1622 in CTT + Cm liquid medium by real time PCR, and found that there was a sharply increased transcription level at the first and last stages, but in the middle stage the transcription level of MXAN_2566 was reduced (Additional file [12](#MOESM12){ref-type="media"}: Fig. S9).

DEGs involved into secondary biosynthetic gene clusters {#Sec9}
-------------------------------------------------------

MXAN_3462, MXAN_3932, MXAN_3933, MXAN_3935, MXAN_3936, MXAN_3938, MXAN_3941, MXAN_4301 and MXAN_6401 located in the gene clusters of primary and secondary fatty acid biosynthesis were significantly upregulated in Cm5-36h (Additional file [13](#MOESM13){ref-type="media"}: Table S4). 6 out of 9 genes (MXAN_3932, MXAN_3933, MXAN_3935, MXAN_3936, MXAN_3938, MXAN_3941) were located in secondary metabolite TA clusters. The other three genes were located in other secondary biosynthetic gene clusters: MXAN_3462 was found in an unidentified myxalamid, MXAN_4301 in a yellow pigment DKxanthene cluster (MXAN_4290 to MXAN_4305), and MXAN_6401 in a lantibiotics cluster. Interestingly, all 20 TA genes (from MXAN3931 to MXAN3950) were upregulated, which suggested that TA biosynthesis was positively related to Cm resistance. Besides the TA gene cluster, the Lichenicidin/Mersacidin biosynthetic gene cluster, belonging to lantipeptide-t2pks, contained 34 genes from MXAN_6380 to MXAN_6413, where 7 genes were upregulated and none of genes were downregulated (Additional file [14](#MOESM14){ref-type="media"}: Table S5). On the contrary, some genes in the other clusters were downregulated, for example, in well studied myxalamid gene cluster (MXAN_4525 to MXAN_4530), 2 out of 5 genes were downregulated. The gene expression level of Myxochromide (MXAN_4077 to MXAN_4079), myxochelin (MXAN_3647 to MXAN_3640) and myxoprincomide (MXAN_3779) gene clusters were not changed in Cm5_36h vs NDK.

The transcription levels of TA clusters Dkxanthene, Myxalamid, Myxochromide, myxochelin, and myxoprincomide were not changed in Cm_8h vs NDK. MXAN_3462, located in an unknown myxalamid cluster, was up-regulated (log2FC, 1.69). Of the related DEGs in the type 2 lantibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster in cm8h, only MXAN_6392 (an acyl carrier protein) and MXAN_6393 (a 3-hydroxyacyl-\[acyl-carrier-protein\] dehydratase FabZ) were up-regulated (log2FC, 2.07, and 1.32, respectively).

DEGs involved in unfolded protein degradation caused by Cm addition {#Sec10}
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Cm can inhibit protein biosynthesis by binding to ribosome to influence the production of proteins. We found that MXAN_4823, MXAN_4824 and MXAN_4825, which consist of one operon encoding the ATP-dependent Clp protease ATP-binding subunit were significantly upregulated (log2FC 1.47, 2.17, 1.92) in Cm5_36h vs NDK. The three genes also were upregulated in cm8h vs NDK (log2FC 3.57, 2.67, 2.61). MXAN_4832 ATP-dependent Clp protease ATP-binding subunit (log2FC 1.19) was also upregulated in Cm_8h vs NDK. ClpA is an ATP-dependent chaperone and part of the ClpAP protease that participates in regulatory protein degradation and the dissolution and degradation of protein aggregates. In both Cm_8h and Cm5_36h vs NDK, these proteases were all upregulated, which might be related to the degradation of unfolded proteins because of Cm-induced functionality disorder of 30S rRNA.

Since the growth rate of the Cm5_36h cells was fast, the transcription of some tRNAs and rRNA were significantly increased, for example, Log2FC of tRNA-Tyr, tRNA-Gly, tRNA-Arg, tRNA-Leu and 23S ribosomal RNA was 5.28, 5.27, 4.60, 2.94 and 3.98 respectively (Additional file [15](#MOESM15){ref-type="media"}: Table S6).

DEGs related to growth arrest, cell cycle, and stress in dormant phenotype Cm_8h {#Sec11}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To understand why Cm_8h has a long lag growth phase and to elucidate the molecular activity of bacteria at this stage, we investigated upregulated genes in Cm_8h vs NDK, where the number of downregulated genes (1295 genes) was larger than that of the upregulated genes (625 genes). DK1622 is a well-studied bacterial strain with a complex lifecycle and forms fruiting-bodies on agar plates under starvation conditions. During growth arrest in CTT + Cm, overall gene expression activity was much lower than that of the exponential phase or the transition to stationary phase. In the transition to stationary phase, RelA can be activated to synthesize alarmone guanosine pentaphosphate (ppGpp), which represses the transcription of rRNA and leads to a redirection of biosynthetic capacity toward more urgent concerns, such as the prevention or repair of DNA damage, or alternatively to osmoprotection. Simultaneously, housekeeping sigma factor RpoD (MXAN_5204) was inhibited (-2.69) and some other RNA polymerase sigma factors were activated in response to this induction, for example, MXAN_0233 (log2FC,1.28), MXAN_2184 (log2FC,1.76), MXAN_4987 (log2FC,2.38). However, we did not observe a change in RelA gene (MXAN_3204) transcription. Genes related to chromosome partition, such as MXAN_7477, were also down regulated (log2FC, -2.15). Genes related to chromosome maintenance and DNA damage were highly activated, for example, DNA starvation/stationary phase protection protein Dps (MXAN_1562 log2FC 2.33), HNH endonuclease (MXAN_1486 log2FC 8.09, MXAN_6077 log2FC 2.14), and virulence-associated protein E domain protein (MXAN_1209 1.98).

To verify the prediction that MXAN_2566 was the main player in Cm resistance in DK1622, we knocked out the gene via homologous recombination using kanamycin selection and galactose counter-selection (Fig. [5](#Fig5){ref-type="fig"}a). Full length MXAN_2566 is 1235-bp, and it was annotated to be a drug resistance MFS transporter belonging to the Bcr/CflA family protein. We obtained strain DK-2566 where the 570-bp interior region was deleted by a PCR method and sequenced (Fig. [5](#Fig5){ref-type="fig"}d). Compared to the wild type strain, a 0.6-kb band appeared in the mutant type strain DK-2566. There was 1.1-kb band in wild type DK1622 (Fig. [5](#Fig5){ref-type="fig"}b). Strain DK-2566 was not grown for 7 days in CTT + Cm liquid medium, but its short growth time was enough to isolate the subsequent mutant strain by Cm screening (Fig. [5](#Fig5){ref-type="fig"}c). We did not observe any difference in the growth curve or doubling time in CTT liquid medium between DK-2566 and wild type DK1622 without Cm supplement. On CTT agar plates, DK-2566 has the same ability to form yellow or tan color colonies as wild type DK1622.Fig. 5Deletion of drug resistant gene MXAN_2566 in *M.xanthus* DK1622. **a** Schematic diagram to delete MXAN_2566 in DK1622 Firstly, pBJ113-2566, which contains two homologous arms, was integrated into the genome of DK1622 by kanamycin selection, and the second crossover occurred by galactose-addition to the culture to obtain strain DK-2566. **b** Identification of double crossover strains DK-2566 by agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR product. Lanes 1 and 2 are the bands from wild type DK1622 (1.1 kb), lanes 3, 4, 5, and 6 show 0.6 kb bands representing the double crossover strain DK-2566 using primer p21 and p24. **c** Growth curves of *M. xanthus* wild type and mutant strains in CTT liquid medium with or without Cm. DK1622Cm indicated the DK1622 already adapted in Cm-containing CTT + Cm liquid medium, accordingly the growth curve of DK1622Cm/CTT + Cm is similar to that of DK1622 in CTT liquid medium. Fresh DK1622 wild type would stay 6 days dormancy in CTT + Cm liquid medium, which has a dormant phase. While drug resistance gene deleted strain DK-2566 stays 9 days dormancy, which is beyond the colony growth time (7 days) on CTT agar plate. 5D. Chromatograms of the 0.6-kb PCR product DNA sequence.

Integration of homologous arms into the genome via Cm selection {#Sec13}
---------------------------------------------------------------

To verify whether strain DK-2566 can be used as a chassis to perform genetic operations by Cm selection, we constructed a series of plasmids contained homologous arms from DK1622 and attempted to integrate the homologous arm into DK-2566. Plasmids pR6K-Cm-11 and pR6K-Cm-14 was electro-transformed into DK-2566. After several round of purification on CTT + Cm agar plates (Fig. [6](#Fig6){ref-type="fig"}a), we performed colony PCR to identify mutant strains containing integrated plasmids by primer pairs 719f and 1534r, which are located in the *cat* gene regions. As shown in Fig. [6](#Fig6){ref-type="fig"}c, 0.8-kb bands were present. Although we obtained mutant strains resistant to Cm (10 μg/ml), not all of the strains contained the 0.8-kb *cat* gene fragment amplified by the primer pairs (Fig. [6](#Fig6){ref-type="fig"}c). To investigate whether the concentration of Cm affected integration efficiency by Cm selection, we performed a Cm selection experiment on CTT + Cm agar plates containing 8, 12, 16 μg/ml of Cm. We found that about 21% integration efficiency was achieved regardless of the concentration of Cm, and higher concentrations did not increase it (Table [3](#Tab3){ref-type="table"}).Fig. 6Integration of homologous recombination by Cm selection in *M. xanthus* DK-2566. **a** Schematic diagram of the integration into the genome of DK-2566 via regular homologous recombination by pR6K-Cm-11. Cm-positive clones were further investigated by PCR with primers (marked in P1 and P2) designed onto the Cm resistant gene CmR (shown in orange). **b** Schematic diagram of the irregular integration into the genome of DK-2566 via irregular homologous recombination by pR6K-Cm-11. Firstly, suicide plasmid pR6K-cm-11 was electro-transformed into the cell of DK-2566. **c** Identification of integration into the genome of DK-2566 by agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products in Cm-positive clones. Lane M1-1,-5,-6,-7, M2-5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10, -11, M3-8 show 0.9 kb bands showing CmR gene of strains DK-2566-11 by primer P1 and P2. No band in other lanes was amplified, although these clones can grow in a Cm agar plate. **d** Identification of correct integration into the genome of DK-2566 was performed using agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products of Cm-positive clones. Primers (marked in P3 and P4) were designed to target both ends of homologous arm (shown in light green). Lanes 1--7 show 1.8 kb bands of the vector region integrated into the genome in strain DK-2566-11 by primer pairs P3 and P4. **e** Verification of irregular integration occurring at the region of the vector was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Primers pairs P5 and P6 located in the backbone were designed to verify that the recombination did not occur at the vector region. **f** Chromatograms of the 1.8 kb PCR product amplified and sequenced using primers P3 and P4 as sequencing primers Table 3 Comparison of integration efficiency via homologous recombination by pR6K-Cm-11after screening at different Cm concentration in DK-2566StrainCm (μg/ml)Number of Cm resistance (three replication)Number of PCR positive by primer P1 and P2 per 100 colonyPCR positive by primer P3 and P4 (%)PCR positive by primer P5 and P6 (%)DK1622101000001000DK-256681001921221000121001920231000161001816251000

To confirm whether the integration occurred at the correct position for the homologous arm in the chromosome, we designed two primer pairs, P3 and P4 to amplify the entire vector sequence (Fig. [6](#Fig6){ref-type="fig"}a). PCR bands at size 1.8 kb were present in all of the *Cat* fragment positive colonies (Fig. [6](#Fig6){ref-type="fig"}d), and PCR products were then verified by sequencing (Fig. [6](#Fig6){ref-type="fig"}f). These results directly indicate that homologous recombination occurred at the correct position, at around 1.0 kb on the homologous arm. To further prove the correct integrational position, we also designed another PCR primer pair, P5 and P6, located in the region of R6K *ori* as counter-evidence and did not obtain any bands, indirectly verifying the integration position (Fig. [6](#Fig6){ref-type="fig"}e).

Discussion {#Sec14}
==========

Acetyltransferases might be involved in Cm resistance in *M. xanthus* {#Sec15}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Transfer of drug resistance to *Myxococcus* from other bacteria carrying drug-resistance R factors, or from *Escherichia coli* phage P1 have already been reported \[[@CR22], [@CR23]\]. Cell-free preparations of Cm-resistant strains can catalyze the acetylation of Cm \[[@CR19]\]. A bacteriophage from *Escherichia coli* can inject its DNA into *M. xanthus* despite the wide taxonomic gap between *Myxococcus* and *E. coli* carrying a gene for Cm resistance into *M. xanthus*, generating unstable antibiotic-resistant strains \[[@CR23]\].

Before we performed RNA sequencing, we presumed that acetyltransferases might be the main factor affecting resistance to Cm and that MXAN_5479 might therefore dominate in Cm resistant strains based on the literature, and predictions made on the whole genome by resistance prediction software. However, we did not observe differences in growth curves upon deletion of MXAN_5479. According to RNA sequencing results, the MXAN_5479 gene was upregulated in cm8h vs NDK, but we did not find any change in transcription levels of MXAN_5479 in cm5_36h vs NDK.

Membrane transporters are involved in drug resistance {#Sec16}
-----------------------------------------------------

MXAN_2566 was the most highly upregulated gene found in Cm resistant phenotype cm5_36h, which belongs to the MFS family of transporters. MXAN_2566 was annotated to be a Cm resistance gene (CmlA/FloR family Cm efflux MFS transporter). After deletion of MXAN_2566, we successfully constructed mutant strain DK-2566 which cannot be grown in CTT + Cm medium. In contrast, MXAN_3444 was annotated to be a tetracycline resistant MFS efflux pump. However, even if MXAN_3444 exists, the *tetR* gene \[*tet* (C)\], which belongs to the MFS_1 superfamily, is often used in genetic operation of *M. xanthus* DK1622, for example in site-specific integration plasmid pSWU30 and homologous recombination plasmid pNG10 \[[@CR9]\].

Multidrug transporters play an important role in the excretion of toxic compounds, occasionally also including specific antimicrobial agents from bacterial cells. Multidrug transporters in bacteria fall into five distinct protein super families, namely the ATP binding cassette super family (ABC), major facilitator super family (MFS), small multidrug resistance super family (SMR), multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) super family, or the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) super family. In the Cm5_36h phenotype, MATE family transporters (MXAN_7022), RND transporters (MXAN_0091), ABC transporters (MXAN_1286), RND transporters (MXAN_0092) are the second, third, fourth and fifth highest upregulated, respectively. However, in the Cm-resistant strain Cm_8h vs NDK, an RND transporter (MXAN_0091) was found to be the most highly upregulated gene (log2FC, 4.65) while a MATE family transporter (MXAN_7022), an ABC transporter (MXAN_4623), and an MFS transporter (MXAN_2566) were the second, third and fourth highly upregulated in Cm_8h vs NDK. We do not know why MXAN_2566 is not the most highly upregulated in the lag phase growth of Cm_8h vs NDK, which was observed as the mostly highly upregulated in Cm5_36h. Therefore, considering the growth curve, we preferentially choose MXAN_2566 (log2FC, 5.60) as a candidate gene for the main resistance factor against Cm in Cm5_36h.

MXAN_0091, MXAN_0092, MXAN_0819, MXAN_2566, MXAN_7022, and MXAN_7119 were simultaneously upregulated in Cm_8h and Cm5_36h cells, indicating that they were all related to the resistance of Cm. This may be the reason why strain DK-2566 is able to remain dormant for 9 days and grow up after the dormancy stage. Numerous upregulated transporters and acetyltransferases explain why we obtained only 21% efficiency for positive colonies in CTT + Cm plate, which indicated there would be a complex mechanism of Cm resistence in *M. xanthus*.

Conclusions {#Sec17}
===========

In this study, we report the induction and characterization of a Cm-resistant phenotype and a Cm-dormant phenotype, compared to a Cm-sensitive phenotype (as a control), based on Illumina RNA sequencing in *M. xanthus* DK1622. In disagreement with reports published 40 years ago, we found that a major facilitating superfamily transporter, not Cm acetyltransferase, played a key role in conferring resistance to Cm in *M. xanthus*. To broaden the spectrum of available molecular tools, we developed an alternative selection system based on Cm by genetic knockout and chromosome integration via homologous recombination. This study provides a new antibiotic selection system and makes steps towards understanding this antibiotic resistance mechanism in *M. xanthus* DK1622.

Sample collection and RNA preparation {#Sec20}
-------------------------------------

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol^®^ Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Three independent biological repeats were conducted for each treatment and extracted RNA samples were mixed together for each treatment. All RNA samples were treated with DNase I (TaKara, Dalian, China). RNA purity was checked using the NanoPhotometer^®^ spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, CA, USA). RNA concentration was measured using the Qubit^®^ RNA Assay Kit in a Qubit^®^ 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). RNA integrity was assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA).

Library preparation for Transcriptome sequencing {#Sec21}
------------------------------------------------

A total amount of 5 μg RNA per sample was used as input material for the RNA sample preparations. Sequencing libraries were generated using Illumina^®^ TruSeq^®^ Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation kit. The first step involves the removal of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) with Ribo-Zero rRNA removal beads. Following purification, the RNA is fragmented into small pieces. The cleaved RNA fragments are copied into the first cDNA strand using reverse transcriptase and random primers. Strand specificity is achieved by replacing dTTP with dUTP in the second strand marking mix (SMM), followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities. After adenylation of 3′ ends of DNA fragments, adaptors with hairpin loop structures were ligated to prepare for hybridization. To select cDNA fragments of preferentially 150--200 bp in length, the library fragments were purified with 2% Low Range Ultra Agarose. The products were enriched with PCR amplification using Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB) for 15 PCR cycles to create the final cDNA library. Library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system.

The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 Truseq SBS Kit v3-HS.

Reads mapping to the reference genome {#Sec22}
-------------------------------------

Raw data (raw reads) in fastq format were first processed by Trimmomatic with default parameters \[[@CR25]\]. Clean data (clean reads) were obtained by removing reads containing adaptors, reads containing poly-N and low quality reads from raw data. At the same time, Q20, Q30 and GC content of the clean data were calculated. All downstream analyses were based on clean data of high quality based on these metrics.

Reference genome and gene model annotation files were directly downloaded from the genome website, with NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_008095.1. Index of the reference genome was built using Bowtie v2.0.6 while paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using TopHat v2.0.9 \[[@CR26]\]. We selected TopHat as the mapping tool as it can generate a database of splice junctions based on gene model annotation files and thus a better mapping result than other non-splice mapping tools. Reads from all sequencing experiments are deposited under accession numbers SRX4504360 for sample NDK, SRX5472518 for sample Cm5-36h, and SRX5472519 for sample Cm_8h at the Sequence Read Archive in the NCBI homepage.

Differential expression analysis and Functional enrichment {#Sec23}
----------------------------------------------------------

HTSeq v0.5.4p3 was used to count the read numbers mapped to each gene \[[@CR27]\] and further, the reads per kilobase of exon model per million reads (RPKM) of each gene was calculated according to the length of the gene and read counts mapped to this gene. RPKM considers the effect of sequencing depth and at the same time the gene length for the read count, and is currently the most commonly used method for estimating gene expression levels. EdgeR was used for differential expression analysis \[[@CR28]\]. The DEGs between two samples were selected using the following criteria for significantly differential expression: (i) absolute value of log2 (fold change) was greater than 1 and (ii) the false discovery rate (FDR) should be \< 0.05. To understand the functions of the differentially expressed genes, GO functional enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis were carried out using Goatools and KOBAS respectively \[[@CR29], [@CR30]\]. DEGs were significantly enriched in GO terms and metabolic pathways when their Bonferroni-corrected P-value was \< 0.05.

Construction of Homologous arms plasmids pBJ113-2566 {#Sec24}
----------------------------------------------------

To construct the suicide plasmid pBJ113-2566, we firstly constructed pBJ113-Up2566 using a method which has been described previously \[[@CR31]\]. First, we amplified the homologous arm using primer pairs DRT-356F and DRT-1280R, which contain *Eco*RI and *Xba*I, respectively. Then, we double digested it using *Eco*RI and *Xba*I, and ligated to linearized pBJ113 \[[@CR32]\] with *EcoR*I + *Xba*I. After confirmation of pBJ113-Up2566 by enzymatic digestion and sequencing, it was linearized using *Xba*I and *Hin*dIII and ligated with the downstream homologous arm which was amplified using primer pairs DRT-1904F and DRT-1904F. This was then double digested using *Xba*I + *Hin*dIII, to give plasmid pBJ113-2566. Finally, the clones were confirmed by double molecular digestion and gene sequencing.

Construction of vector pR6K-cm and homologous recombination plasmids pR6K-Cm-11, pR6K-Cm-14 {#Sec25}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To completely avoid the occurrence of the homologous recombination between the pBR322 derived origin region, we constructed a vector which contains a different ori R6K. Plasmid pR6K-Cm-ccdB and *E.coli* GBdir-pir116 \[[@CR33]\] were used to construct plasmid pR6K-Cm by primer pairs XE307F, H-1534R and self-ligation. Plasmid pR6k-Cm was double digested by *Xba*I and *Hin*dIII and ligated with the digested fragment, amplified with primer pairs S11D-141f, S11D-2093R and S14D-1057f, S14D-2649R to construct plasmid pR6K-Cm-11, and pR6K-Cm-14.

Construction of mutant strain DK-2566 and homologous recombination by Cm selection in DK-2566 {#Sec26}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To obtain the MFS deletion strain, we used the suicide plasmid pBJ113-2566 which contained two homologous arms to integrate into the genome of DK1622 \[[@CR34]\] by kanamycin selection. After confirming integration by PCR amplification, the double crossover occurred on CTT + galactose agar plates. Correct recombinant colonies were confirmed by PCR amplification as well as by gene sequencing.

By the same method, we transformed the plasmid pR6K-cm-11 and pR6K-cm-14 into the DK-2566 strain. Strains DK-2566-cm11 and DK-2566-cm14 were obtained by Cm selection using different concentrations of CTT + Cm agar plates, and were confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing.

<|endoftext|>In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks and destroys β cells. At the clinical onset of type 1 diabetes, 15--40% of β cells are still able to produce insulin, thus blocking further autoimmune destruction even at this stage, holding great promise for arresting disease progression ([@B1]). Yet earlier intervention in individuals with documented autoimmune disease but without clinically manifest diabetes is of course the ultimate goal in any future intervention strategy to prevent diabetes. Following this rationale, a growing number of clinical intervention studies, with the common goal of blocking autoimmune disease and reestablishing long-term tolerance to β cells based on immunomodulation, have been initiated in the past decade ([@B2]).

The liver has unique immunological properties that affect T-cell activation and immune regulation. Although the liver is an important site for T-cell activation, this takes place in the context of immunosuppressive cytokines and a distinctive local immune environment, so that exposure to antigens often results in tolerance rather than immunity ([@B3]). Tolerance promotion can be mediated, among other mechanisms, by the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) capable of inhibiting effector responses in the periphery ([@B4]). However, the key hepatic cell type responsible for initiating this phenomenon remains controversial. Whereas several reports point to hepatocytes, others indicate nonparenchymal cells (NPCs) as the cells that promote expansion of specific Treg populations able to limit autoreactive immunity ([@B5]). Engineering hepatic cells to express molecules able to induce Tregs therefore represents a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of autoimmune disorders ([@B5]). A number of gene transfer studies have described the ectopic expression of autoantigens in the liver as a means to promote peripheral control of autoreactive lymphocytes by increasing either the number and/or the function of Tregs ([@B6]). Also, it has been shown repeatedly, in both mice and nonhuman primates, that upon in vivo liver-directed gene transfer of coagulation factor IX, transgene expression has the capacity to provide therapeutic circulating levels while inducing immune tolerance to the transgene product ([@B7],[@B8]). Thus, in the context of an autoimmune disease such as type 1 diabetes, a liver-targeted gene therapy approach to modify peripheral control of autoreactive lymphocytes offers a unique possibility to prevent development and progression of the disease. To achieve this would require efficient and targeted expression to tolerogenic cells as well as utilization of an appropriate immunomodulatory transgene. Among the possible immunomodulatory candidate genes for type 1 diabetes is IGF-I. We have previously reported that expression of IGF-I in β cells of transgenic mice counteracts the cytotoxicity and insulitis induced by treatment with multiple low doses of streptozotocin (STZ) ([@B9],[@B10]). Moreover, daily subcutaneous administration of human recombinant IGF-I to prediabetic NOD mice reduces the severity of insulitis and the incidence of type 1 diabetes ([@B11]--[@B13]). All these studies reveal IGF-I as a key factor able to induce protection from type 1 diabetes.

In this work, we report that after delivery of a plasmid expressing IGF-I to the liver by hydrodynamic tail vein (HTV) injection, the incidence of diabetes decreases in an autoimmune mouse model of the disease. We show that the expression of IGF-I in liver NPCs leads to an increase in intrapancreatic Tregs, resulting in decreased pancreatic infiltration, reduced β-cell apoptosis, and increased β-cell replication, suggesting a blockage of the autoimmune attack against the pancreas.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS {#s1}
===========================

Animals. {#s2}
--------

Heterozygous male transgenic mice expressing human interferon (IFN)-β under the control of the rat insulin promoter-I were used ([@B9]). Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of very low doses of STZ (25 mg/kg body weight) dissolved in citrate buffer (pH 4.5) on 5 consecutive days. All mice were fed ad libitum with a standard chow diet (2018S Teklad Global; Harlan) and maintained under conditions of controlled temperature and light (12-h light/dark cycles). Animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee in Animal and Human Experimentation of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.

Plasmids and hydrodynamic injection. {#s3}
------------------------------------

The HTV procedure was performed as described ([@B14]). The CAG, hAAT, and CD68 promoters were cloned substituting the CMV promoter from the commercial pVAX plasmid (Invitrogen). Animals in all STZ control (STZ-Con) groups were injected with the CMV-containing version of pVAX. The hAAT promoter was kindly provided by Dr. Katherine High, University of Pennsylvania.

β-Cell mass, replication, and apoptosis. {#s4}
----------------------------------------

Determination of β-cell mass, replication, and apoptosis was performed as described ([@B9],[@B15]).

Hormone and metabolite assays. {#s5}
------------------------------

Blood glucose levels were measured with a Glucometer Elite analyzer (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany). Serum insulin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay (CIS Biointernational, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France). For the glucose tolerance test, awake mice that were fasted overnight (16 h) were administered an intraperitoneal injection of glucose (1 g/kg body weight). The circulating levels of IGF-I were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 15 μL serum samples using the OCTEIA Rat/Mouse IGF-I ELISA (Immunodiagnostic Systems, Boldon, U.K.) following the manufacturer's instructions.

Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. {#s6}
------------------------------------------------

Peripheral blood obtained from mice was diluted 1:1 with PBS plus 0.1% BSA, layered onto an appropriate volume of Histopaque 1083 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and centrifuged at 800*g* for 20 min. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the gradient interface and washed in PBS plus 0.1% BSA before staining with a specific antibody for flow cytometry analysis.

Isolation of hepatic NPCs. {#s7}
--------------------------

Intrahepatic lymphocytes were isolated from liver as previously described ([@B16]).

Flow cytometry and cell sorting. {#s8}

Cells from liver, spleen, peripheral blood, and pancreas were isolated as described above. CD11b, CD19, CD4, CD8, Gr-1, F4/80, CD25, FoxP3 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA), and CD11c (BD PharMingen, San José, CA) antibodies were used. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FC500 MPL (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) and data were analyzed using FCS 3 Express software (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA). CD11b^+^ cells were sorted using a FacsAria sorter (Becton Dickinson). RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy Plus Micro kit following manufacturer's instructions.

In vivo depletion of Tregs and natural killer cells. {#s9}
----------------------------------------------------

For Treg depletion, anti-CD25 antibody (purified anti-mouse CD25 antibody, clone PC61; Biolegend) or normal rabbit serum were used. The antibody was injected intraperitoneally (30 µg in 40 µL of water) the same day as the first IGF-I injection, and a second administration was given 3 days later. For natural killer (NK) cells depletion, the antiasialo GM1 antibody (Anti-Mouse Asialo GM1; Diagnostica Longwood) was injected intraperitoneally (300 µg in 40 µL of water).

RT-PCR and quantitative PCR. {#s10}
----------------------------

One µg RNA was retrotranscribed using the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions. The following specific primers were used: GFP (F: 5′AAGTTCATCTGCACCACCG3′; R: 5′TCCTTGAAGAAGATGGTGCGC3′); Igf1 (F: 5′CTGGGCAACGTGCTGGTTATT3′; R: 5′GGGTTTGTGAAAGCATCTACGGAA3′); Il10 (F: 5′ ACTGCACCCACTTCCCAGT3′; R: 5′TGTCCAGCTGGTCCTTTGTT3′); Il7 (F: 5′ ATTATGGGTGGTGAGAGCCG3′; R: 5′GTTCCTGTCATTTTGTCCAATTCA3′); Tgfb1 (F: 5′GCAACATGTGGAACTCTACCAG3′; R: 5′ CAGCCACTCAGGCGTATCA3′); RBS (Rps26) (F: 5′ ATTCGCTGCACGAACTGCG 3′; R: 5′ CAGCAGGTCTGAATCGTGGT 3′).

Gene transfer to liver NPCs after HTV injection of plasmid DNA. {#s13}
---------------------------------------------------------------

Hepatic cells can be efficiently transduced with both viral and nonviral strategies to express and secrete proteins. We hypothesized that for liver-mediated induction of tolerance to autoantigens, it would suffice with transient expression of the candidate gene. Such short-term expression can be achieved safely through HTV injection of plasmid DNA ([@B14]). However, because the full repertoire of cells transduced after HTV injection is unknown, and it is not clear which cells are required for tolerance induction, we analyzed GFP expression in several liver cell populations after injection of plasmid DNA with different promoter constructs. We found that in addition to hepatocytes ([@B17]), HTV injection of a plasmid-encoding GFP under control of the ubiquitously expressed CAG promoter (pCAG-GFP) efficiently transduced Kupffer cells (KCs) ([Fig. 1*A*](#F1){ref-type="fig"}, panels A--C, and [Supplementary Fig. 1A](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db11-1776/-/DC1)). In contrast, after HTV injection of a plasmid expressing GFP under the control of a hepatocyte-specific promoter (hAAT) ([@B18]), only GFP^+^ hepatocytes (but not KCs) were detected ([Fig. 1*A*](#F1){ref-type="fig"}, panels D--F). However, when a myeloid-specific promoter (CD68) ([@B19]) was used to drive the expression of GFP, only GFP^+^ KCs could be readily detected ([Fig. 1*A*](#F1){ref-type="fig"}, panels G--I, and [Supplementary Fig. 1B](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db11-1776/-/DC1)). After HTV injection, hepatic expression of GFP plasmids was maximal at 24 h but progressively declined thereafter ([Supplementary Fig. 2](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db11-1776/-/DC1)). As a control, injection of an adeno-associated virus serotype 8 expressing GFP led to long-term expression of GFP in hepatocytes, but KCs remained GFP-negative, consistent with the poor tropism of adeno-associated virus serotype 8 for KCs ([@B20]) ([Fig. 1*A*](#F1){ref-type="fig"}, panels J--L). Flow cytometry analysis of liver NPCs showed that ∼20% of KCs and intrahepatic B lymphocytes, and 5--10% of dendritic cells (DCs) and T lymphocytes were GFP^+^ after HTV injection of pCAG-GFP ([Fig. 1*B*](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). RT-PCR analysis of FACS-sorted KC confirmed GFP expression ([Fig. 1*C*](#F1){ref-type="fig"}), demonstrating that liver NPCs can express foreign genes after HTV injection. Thus, this nonviral gene transfer approach may be used to transiently express genes of interest in liver parenchymal and/or NPCs. Our finding is in disagreement with previous data that showed plasmid-derived expression after HTV injection to be confined to hepatocytes ([@B21]).

Plasmid-derived expression of IGF-I in liver prevents the development of type 1 diabetes. {#s14}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We then tested the ability of the liver to modulate autoreactive lymphocytes by combining the antidiabetic effects of IGF-I with the tolerogenic environment of the liver after HTV injection of IGF-I-expressing plasmids to a transgenic mouse model of type 1 diabetes. These mice express human interferon-β in β cells (TgIFN-β), which results in lymphocytic infiltration of islets and development of overt diabetes when mice are treated with very low doses of STZ, which do not induce diabetes in wild-type mice ([@B9],[@B22]). By selecting different promoters, IGF-I was transiently expressed in hepatocytes, NPCs, or both. First, TgIFN-β mice were treated with STZ and 1 week later were administered weekly HTV injections of 5 μg of either pCAG-IGF-I (STZ-CAG-IGF-I) or a noncoding plasmid (STZ-Con). Non-STZ-treated TgIFN-β mice were used as controls. Hepatic transgene-specific IGF-I expression was confirmed by RT-PCR ([Fig. 2*A*](#F2){ref-type="fig"}). Eight weeks post-STZ, 90% of STZ-Con mice were highly hyperglycemic, whereas ∼83% of STZ-CAG-IGF-I animals did not have development of diabetes ([Fig. 2*B*](#F2){ref-type="fig"}). All mice showed similar levels of circulating IGF-I (Con, 671 ± 62; STZ-Con, 601 ± 183; STZ-CAG-IGF-I, 594 ± 164 ng/mL). After 10 IGF-I plasmid administrations, STZ-CAG-IGF-I normoglycemic mice reached permanent protection from type 1 diabetes and did not require further treatment ([Fig. 2*B*](#F2){ref-type="fig"}). On the contrary, although a similar percentage of animals were initially protected from diabetes after receiving only four pCAG-IGF-I administrations, this protection was not sustained over time and 5 weeks after withdrawing the IGF-I treatment the percentage of diabetic animals increased to ∼43% ([Fig. 2*C*](#F2){ref-type="fig"}), indicating that a longer IGF-I treatment was needed to fully protect from immune-mediated destruction of β cells.

The early stages of diabetic pathogenesis are characterized by insulitis, an inflammation of the islets of Langerhans caused by lymphocytic infiltration. The insulitis score was determined 15 days and 4 months after STZ treatment. Approximately 30% of islets in non-STZ-treated control mice showed lymphocytic infiltration, mainly consisting of peri-insulitis ([Fig. 3*A*](#F3){ref-type="fig"}), as previously reported ([@B9]). Fifteen days after STZ treatment, the percentage of infiltrated islets increased to 70% in STZ-Con mice, with more than 25% of islets highly infiltrated. In normoglycemic CAG-IGF-I\--treated animals, insulitis was significantly lower, although not completely cleared, as determined by immunohistochemical and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis ([Fig. 3*B*, *C*](#F3){ref-type="fig"}). This decreased infiltration suggests that pCAG-IGF-I treatment blocked the autoimmune attack against β cells. Four months after STZ treatment, only few insulin-positive cells could be detected in STZ-Con pancreas, and the remaining islets were small and highly infiltrated. In contrast, most of the islets in normoglycemic pCAG-IGF-I\--treated mice were noninfiltrated ([Fig. 3*C*](#F3){ref-type="fig"}).

Plasmid-derived expression of IGF-I in the liver normalizes pancreatic β-cell mass, insulinemia, and glucose tolerance. {#s15}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To study if exogenous IGF-I expression in the liver protected β cells from STZ-induced apoptosis, we identified apoptotic cells in paraffin sections with TUNEL staining and non-β cells with an antiglucagon, antisomatostatin, and antipancreatic polypeptide antibody cocktail. Two weeks after STZ treatment, a great increase in TUNEL-positive β cells was detected in islets of mock-treated mice. In contrast, islets of IGF-I-treated mice showed a 2.5-fold reduction in the number of apoptotic cells ([Fig. 4*A*](#F4){ref-type="fig"}). Double immunostaining for insulin and the proliferation marker Ki67 was used to identify replicating β cells and determine whether replication of existing β cells occurred after IGF-I treatment. Two weeks after STZ treatment, a two-fold increase in Ki67-positive β cells was detected in IGF-I animals compared with STZ-treated controls ([Fig. 4*B*](#F4){ref-type="fig"}). The higher replication rate and decreased apoptosis of β cells contributed to a striking increase (more than four-fold) in the number of β cells per pancreas area in STZ-IGF-I\--treated mice compared with STZ-treated mice ([Fig. 4*C*](#F4){ref-type="fig"}). As a result, circulating insulin levels measured 4 months after diabetes induction in CAG-IGF-I treated mice were normalized ([Fig. 4*D*](#F4){ref-type="fig"}) and STZ-CAG-IGF-I mice showed normal tolerance to glucose ([Fig. 4*E*](#F4){ref-type="fig"}). Thus, the abrogation of autoimmune β-cell attack was sufficient to preserve β-cell function in STZ-CAG-IGF-I\--treated mice.

Nonparenchymal cell-derived IGF-I protects islets from diabetes. {#s16}
----------------------------------------------------------------

Because HTV injection mediates transduction of both hepatocytes and nonhepatocyte cells in the liver ([Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}), we used cell-type specific promoters to restrict IGF-I expression to target cells to discern the populations responsible for diabetes protection. A plasmid expressing IGF-I under the control of the hepatocyte-specific hAAT promoter (phAAT-IGF-I) was administered weekly for 4 weeks. Similar to STZ-Con mice, 100% of STZ-hAAT-IGF-I\--treated mice had development of diabetes ([Fig. 5*A*](#F5){ref-type="fig"}), indicating that hepatocyte-derived IGF-I is ineffective in protecting islets from lymphocytic infiltration. In contrast, when a plasmid expressing IGF-I under the control of the KC-specific CD68 promoter (pCD68-IGF-I) was administered to STZ-treated mice, ∼60% of mice were protected from diabetes, whereas 100% of STZ-Con mice had development of diabetes ([Fig. 5*B*](#F5){ref-type="fig"}). In this experimental group, the expression in hepatic NPC of IGF-I derived from the plasmid was confirmed by RT-PCR ([Supplementary Fig. 3](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db11-1776/-/DC1)). These results show that IGF-I expression in nonparenchymal liver cells is necessary and sufficient to suppress diabetes progression. The slightly lower degree of protection as compared with the CAG-IGF-I\--treated mice could reflect differences in the expression levels of plasmid-derived IGF-I. Alternatively, it may suggest that other hepatic cell types also play a role in preventing diabetes onset. Several studies have shown that other NPC types such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells ([@B23]), DCs ([@B24]), stellate cells ([@B25]), and lymphocytes ([@B26]) can mediate liver-derived immune tolerance in several animal models of autoimmune diseases.

We measured by flow cytometry the frequency of several types of hepatic NPCs after pIGF-I treatment. The numbers of CD4^+^ T lymphocytes and NK cells were increased in livers of IGF-I-treated mice, whereas the percentage of hepatic CD8^+^ T cells was decreased in both CAG-IGF-I\--treated and CD68-IGF-I\--treated animals ([Supplementary Fig. 4A, B](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db11-1776/-/DC1)). Importantly, no changes were detected in the frequency of peripheral macrophages, DCs or lymphocytes with either treatment ([Supplementary Fig. 4C, D](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db11-1776/-/DC1)). The only exception was a decrease in circulating NK cells in the CAG-IGF-I group ([Supplementary Fig. 4C](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db11-1776/-/DC1)). IGF-I treatment also led to a significant increase in liver CD11b^+^Gr1^+^ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), in both STZ-CAG-IGF-I and STZ-CD68-IGF-I mice 2 weeks post-STZ ([Fig. 5*C*, *D*](#F5){ref-type="fig"}). Nevertheless, the percentage of CD11b^+^ cells remained unchanged ([Fig. 5*E*](#F5){ref-type="fig"}). In addition to being potent suppressors of various T-cell functions, MDSCs can also induce Treg development ([@B27]). The percentage of hepatic DCs was also increased ([Fig. 5*F*](#F5){ref-type="fig"}). To rule out the possibility that these differences were attributable to changes in total cell numbers (e.g., presence of an inflammatory infiltrate in response to higher numbers of CpG motifs in the IGF-I plasmid as compared with the noncoding one), the total amount of CD11b^+^ and CD11c^+^ cells was measured in a separate cohort of mice that received either CAG-IGF-I or noncoding plasmid and compared with an uninjected control group. Importantly, both plasmid-treated groups had equivalent CD11b^+^ and CD11c^+^ cell numbers in the liver (data not shown). To further determine the effects of IGF-I expression on DCs, the DCs from livers of healthy mice were isolated and cultured in vitro in the presence of exogenous IGF-I and the expression of key immunosuppressive cytokines was analyzed by quantitative PCR. IGF-I-treated DCs showed an increase in transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and interleukin (IL)-7 expression, whereas IL-10 remained unchanged ([Fig. 5*G*](#F5){ref-type="fig"}). TGF-β is critically involved in peripheral conversion of conventional T cells to Tregs ([@B28]), whereas IL-7 is a survival factor for Tregs and is expressed by diabetes-suppressive immature DCs ([@B29]).

Roles of Treg and NK cells in diabetes modulation. {#s17}
--------------------------------------------------

Tregs play a major role in the control of type 1 diabetes ([@B30]). To define if changes in Tregs populations underlie the ability of hepatic IGF-I expression to protect from diabetes, we analyzed the percentage of intrahepatic and intrapancreatic Tregs after pCAG-IGF-I treatment. A significant (approximately two-fold) increase of CD4^+^CD25^+^Foxp3^+^ Tregs in the pancreas of IGF-I-treated animals was found ([Fig. 6*A*](#F6){ref-type="fig"}). An increase of approximately two-fold in intrahepatic Tregs, albeit nonsignificant, also was observed when compared with STZ-Con mice ([Fig. 6*B*](#F6){ref-type="fig"}). The contribution of Tregs in the prevention of diabetes was further studied by depleting this cell population with an anti-CD25 antibody as previously described ([@B31]). Treg depletion in the absence of STZ failed to trigger diabetes onset ([Supplementary Fig. 5](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db11-1776/-/DC1)). As expected from previous experiments, IGF-I treatment prevented the development of diabetes in ∼70% of STZ-treated mice, whereas the depletion of CD25^+^ lymphocytes completely abolished the IGF-I-mediated protective effect ([Fig. 6*C*](#F6){ref-type="fig"}, left and middle panels). Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes showed that the levels of Treg cells declined most significantly at week 1 and gradually returned to normal within 3 weeks ([Fig. 6*D*](#F6){ref-type="fig"}). However, animals remained diabetic.

Our observation of a decrease in circulating and an increase in intrahepatic NK cells after pIGF-I treatment, as well as recent work from others ([@B32]), suggest a prominent role of this lymphocyte population in diabetes development. Also, it has been described for humans and mice that Tregs can suppress NK cell functions, including cytotoxicity ([@B33],[@B34]). To assess the relevance of NK cells in the development of diabetes, we administered an antiasialo GM1 antibody to deplete this lymphocyte population ([@B32],[@B35]). Depletion of NK cells reduced the incidence of diabetes to 60% in STZ-Con animals, whereas it completely abolished the incidence of the disease in IGF-I-treated animals ([Fig. 6*C*](#F6){ref-type="fig"}, right panel). This and the reduction of NK population in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in IGF-I-treated animals indicate that prevention from diabetes after IGF-I treatment may be mediated, at least in part, by a decrease in the number of NK cells. Collectively, these results highlight the central role of Tregs and NK cells, in our animal model, in preventing or accelerating the disease, respectively.

DISCUSSION {#s18}
==========

In the current study, we showed that plasmid-derived IGF-I expression in the liver of prediabetic TgIFN-β mice protects from type 1 diabetes. Whereas concurrent expression of IGF-I in hepatocytes and NPCs led to disease protection, NPC-specific IGF-I expression was sufficient to prevent the onset of the disease. Our results suggest a key role of NPCs in promoting expansion of Treg populations able to limit autoreactive immunity because hepatic IGF-I expression caused enhanced CD4^+^CD25^+^Foxp3^+^ Treg number and tolerogenic function. We previously proposed that IGF-I is an interesting candidate to prevent type 1 diabetes ([@B9],[@B10]). However, to our knowledge, this is the first study to report the use of a gene therapy approach using IGF-I as a protective agent against autoimmune diabetes.

First, we characterized the liver cell populations that were transduced after hydrodynamic injection of plasmid DNA. It was unexpectedly observed that in addition to hepatocytes, other hepatic cells were also transduced. Previous work by others had established that plasmid DNA injected under HTV conditions could be found within endothelial cells and KCs ([@B17],[@B21]). However, actual expression in NPCs was not detected. The discrepancy with our work may be attributable to the lack of use of specific antibodies against NPCs in the previous studies to unequivocally identify transduced NPCs. Thus, it is possible that transduced NPCs were misidentified as being hepatocytes. Through immunohistochemical analysis, PCR and flow cytometry data to show GFP-positive NPCs after HTV injection, we provide strong evidence that NPCs are able to express plasmid-derived DNA after HTV. Because a significant percentage of nonparenchymal immune liver cells, such as KCs and DCs, are transduced after HTV injection, our data may have implications for the interpretation of gene therapy experiments targeting the liver using this nonviral technique.

We took advantage of the transient expression of transgenes in specific liver cell types mediated by plasmid HTV to examine whether exogenous IGF-I expression in the liver could prevent autoimmune diabetes in a transgenic mouse model of the disease. TgIFN-β mice treated with very low doses of STZ comprised the model used in the study presented herein. We ([@B9],[@B22]) and others ([@B35],[@B36]) have established the TgIFN-β mice as a model of type 1 diabetes devoid of some of the limitations present in the most widely used NOD mouse model; namely, there is a major gender bias in the incidence of diabetes: ∼80% of disease incidence in NOD females versus ∼0--40% in males. NOD mice harbor a plethora of genetically fixed immune defects, such as dysfunctional NK cells and lack of hemolytic complement, that distinguish these mice from human patients. Also, the incidence of disease is highest when NOD mice are maintained in a relatively germ-free environment but dramatically decreases when in conventional housing facilities. It is now acknowledged that type 1 diabetes is such a complex and heterogeneous disease that the use, or overuse as already pointed out by some authors ([@B37]), of the NOD model as the single model of the disease may result in a limited landscape of both basic and translational research in the field of autoimmune diabetes. On the contrary, TgIFN-β mice show normal reproduction and life span, and both male and female have development of diabetes after treatment with very low doses of STZ. Thus, the use of these transgenic mice offers advantages because studies in diabetic male or female mice can be easily programmed, depending on the experimental needs. Furthermore, when TgIFN-β mice are backcrossed with NOD mice, development of diabetes is clearly accelerated ([@B38]). These features indicate that TgIFN-β mice may be an important tool for dissecting tolerance mechanisms and assaying new treatments for this disease.

A large body of evidence indicates that Tregs play a central role in retarding and/or suppressing diabetes onset ([@B39]). Recently, Grinberg-Bleyer et al. ([@B40]) have showed that increasing the number of Treg cells locally in the pancreas can reverse established disease in NOD mice. In our work, an increase in intrapancreatic Treg cells was detected in IGF-I-treated mice compared with those treated with a noncoding plasmid. The induction of TGF-β production after the exposure of isolated liver-derived mononuclear cells to IGF-I in vitro suggests that the increase in the number of Tregs may be the result of augmented conversion of conventional T cells into Tregs ([@B41]). However, we also detected an increase in IL-7 transcription in cultured DCs exposed to IGF-I. Giannoukakis et al. ([@B29]) have shown that DCs derived from NOD mice engineered ex vivo to become immunoregulatory increased their prevalence of Tregs via the action of IL-7. Their work described IL-7 as a survival factor for Tregs. Thus, the observed increase in Tregs also may be the result of an improvement in Treg survival.

Despite the importance of Tregs in diabetes prevention in the experiments presented herein, the participation of other key players cannot be ruled out. A role for NK cells in the development of diabetes was also envisaged in this study. We observed a decrease in the levels of circulating NK cells in IGF-I-treated animals along with an increase in intrahepatic NK cells. This observation bears similarities to the studies of John and Crispe ([@B42]) in which they described an inverse correlation between the frequency of activated CD8^+^ T cells trapped in the liver and their frequency in the circulating pool. We also detected an increase in CD4^+^ cells in the liver after treatment with IGF-I plasmids. Studies reporting accumulation of activated CD8^+^ cells ([@B43]) and NK cells ([@B44]) during tolerance induction suggest an important role for the liver in this process. Whereas CD8^+^ cell accumulation seems to lead to destruction of activated CD8^+^ cells, in the presence of the antigen NK cells seem to play an anti-inflammatory role in the liver. In addition, the recent finding that MDSCs affect NK activity via TGF-β and that downregulation of splenic and liver NK cell function is inversely correlated with the marked increase of MDSCs in liver and spleen ([@B45]) might explain the relevance of NK cells in our studies. It also has been described that Tregs could suppress NK cell functions, including cytotoxicity, NKG2D expression, and IFN production in humans and mice ([@B33],[@B34]).

Collectively, our data suggest that complex interactions between different cellular types (Tregs, NK cells, and MDSCs) may be responsible for the observed diabetes prevention after IGF-I treatment. Although our study using HTV injection of plasmid DNA to prevent autoimmune diabetes represents a proof of concept in mice, recent progress toward a clinically applicable hydrodynamic gene delivery procedure ([@B46]) may favor the translation of such in vivo approaches for the treatment of autoimmune diseases in human subjects.

Mardell PALMER, Appellant (Plaintiff),
v.
BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF CROOK COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1, Appellee (Defendant).
No. 89-78.
Supreme Court of Wyoming.
January 12, 1990.
*1161 James L. Edwards of Stevens, Edwards & Hallock, Gillette, for appellant.
Mark L. Hughes of Hughes & Dumbrill, Sundance, for appellee.
Tracy J. Copenhaver of Copenhaver, Kath & Kitchen, Powell, filed an amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Wyoming School Boards Ass'n.
Before CARDINE, C.J., and THOMAS, URBIGKIT, MACY and GOLDEN, JJ.
GOLDEN, Justice.
Appellant Mardell Palmer (Palmer) challenges the district court's judgment affirming her termination and seeks reinstatement as a continuing contract teacher in Crook County School District No. 1 (District). She asserts that the School District Board of Trustees (Board) acted arbitrarily, capriciously and illegally in terminating her employment pursuant to the Board's Reduction in Professional Staff Work Force (RIF) policy.
Appellant raises the following issues on appeal:
I. Did the administration attempt to realign the classes and courses to be taught in accordance with the reduction in force (RIF) policy and not infringe on the right of the appellant as a continuing contract teacher?
II. Did the Crook County School Board properly implement the District RIF policy?
III. Did the Board of Trustees conduct themselves in an arbitrary and capricious manner toward the appellant through either their notice and conduct at the April 7, 1988, meeting, or their findings of fact and conclusions of law?
In contrast, the District frames the issue on appeal in the context of the scope of judicial review pursuant to W.S. 16-3-114(c)(ii) (Oct. 1982 Repl.). Appellee identifies the issue as:
I. Was the decision of the District Court and the Board of Trustees of Crook County School District No. 1 to terminate the contract of Mardell Palmer:
a. Arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;
b. Contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege or immunity;
c. In excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority or limitations or lacking statutory right;
d. Without observance of procedure required by law; or
e. Unsupported by substantial evidence?
Finally, in an amicus brief submitted on behalf of the District by the Wyoming School Boards Association, two issues are addressed:
I. Does a teacher by virtue of acquiring continuing contract status have the right to require the Board of Trustees to realign teachers and curriculum so as to create a position for her when such realignment would be contrary to the Board's determination of what is in the best interests of the students?
II. Did the Board of Trustees of Crook County School District No. 1 properly implement the RIF policy and procedures, including requirements for notice to the teacher, and was the determination of the Board arbitrary, capricious or unsupported by substantial evidence?
We affirm.

FACTS
Palmer taught physical education and general science at Sundance High School for seven consecutive years until the end of the 1987-88 school year. In March, 1988, she became aware that the District, faced with financial concerns and a declining enrollment, was considering implementing its RIF policy by eliminating several staff positions, including her own combination physical education/science position. On April 7, 1988, Palmer, accompanied by counsel, attended a special meeting of the Board where they discussed the proposed RIF with the Board. The Board also heard comments from several individuals on behalf of Palmer and received petitions supporting *1162 her continued employment. Despite these factors, the Board accepted a recommendation from the District Superintendent to implement the RIF policy. In addition to Palmer's position as a physical education/science teacher, the Board voted to eliminate five and one-half other teaching positions in the District. All teachers in the District received notice of the Board's action to implement the RIF policy following the April 7 special meeting.
Palmer received written notice of recommendation of her termination on or about April 12, 1988. The notice, dated April 11, 1988, contained three reasons for the Board's reduction in the teaching staff: (1) limited financial resources of the District; (2) decreased enrollment; and (3) other events beyond the control of the Board. On April 15, 1988, Palmer requested a hearing before the Board pursuant to W.S. 21-7-108 (July 1986 Repl.); the Board granted Palmer's request and conducted a hearing on June 22, 1988. Discovery of additional evidence necessitated a supplemental hearing held on October 3, 1988. Following both hearings, the Board voted to terminate Palmer's employment with the District effective at the end of the 1987-88 school year.
Pursuant to W.R.A.P. 12 and W.S. 16-3-114, Palmer petitioned the district court for review of the Board's administrative action, and on October 12, 1988, the district court heard oral arguments and reviewed the record. The court concluded that the Board had authority under W.S. 21-7-111(a)(iv) (Cum.Supp. 1988)[1] to terminate a continuing contract teacher due to limited financial resources and decreased enrollment. The court recognized the limited scope of judicial review of discretionary administrative actions supported by substantial evidence. On February 28, 1989, the district court entered an order affirming the Board's action terminating Palmer. This appeal followed.
Having reviewed the record and briefs, we recognize two issues for decision. First, we must consider whether the District satisfied procedural notice requirements; and second, we must determine whether the Board's decision to terminate Palmer was supported by substantial evidence.
The standard of judicial review for administrative actions is governed by W.R.A.P. 12.09, W.S. 16-3-114(c)[2] and Wyoming case law. We apply the same standard of judicial review previously applied by the district court in this case. In determining whether an agency decision is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion, a court must review the record taken as a whole and ascertain whether the decision is supported by the evidence contained in the record. Holding's Little America v. Board of County Commissioners of Laramie County, 670 P.2d 699, 703-04 (Wyo. 1983); and Toavs v. State By & Through Real Estate Commission, 635 P.2d 1172, 1174 (Wyo. 1981). We are not bound to accept any of the conclusions reached in the district court, but are obligated to review the appeal as if it came directly to the court from the Board. Sellers v. Wyoming Board of Psychologist Examiners, 739 P.2d 125, 126 (Wyo. 1987). Deference is owed to the Board's administrative determination, not that of the district court's decision. Zezas Ranch, Inc. v. Board of Control, 714 P.2d 759, 764 (Wyo. 1986).
Palmer argues that the Board abused its discretion by making its decision *1163 without a sufficient factual basis. W.S. 16-3-114(c)(ii)(E) establishes that administrative actions mut be supported by "substantial evidence" or be reversed on judicial review. On several occasions this court has defined the "substantial evidence" test in the school board administrative context. In Shenefield v. Sheridan County School District No. 1, 544 P.2d 870, 874 (Wyo. 1976) (quoting Howard v. Lindmier, 67 Wyo. 78, 214 P.2d 737, 740 (1950)), the court defined substantial evidence as "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." See also Ririe v. Board of Trustees of School District No. One, Crook County, Wyoming, 674 P.2d 214, 228 (Wyo. 1983); and Board of Trustees, Laramie County School District No. 1 v. Spiegel, 549 P.2d 1161, 1178 (Wyo. 1976). The weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of witnesses is to be determined by the finder of fact (the Board in this case) and not the reviewing court. The burden is on the appellant to demonstrate that the Board's decision is not supported by substantial evidence. Westates Construction Co. v. Sheridan County School District No. 2, Board of Trustees, 719 P.2d 1366, 1372 (Wyo. 1986).

PROCEDURAL NOTICE REQUIREMENTS
Palmer contends that the District's published notice of the April 7, 1988 special board meeting was inaccurate in that the notice printed in the local newspaper and the copies of the meeting agenda distributed to Board members failed to state that reduction in the professional staff work force would be discussed at the meeting. The District counters Palmer's claim with evidence of compliance with W.S. 16-4-404(b) (Oct. 1982 Repl.).[3] The District argues that express notice of "hiring professional staff," in conjunction with Palmer's constructive notice of the purpose of the meeting and community awareness of topics to be discussed satisfies the statutory notice requirement.
Palmer's procedural argument fails since the record establishes that the District met the requirements of the law, and in any case, Palmer did not suffer as a result of the alleged improper notice. While it is questionable whether "hiring professional staff" is synonymous with "reduction in force," there is no doubt that the business to be transacted at the special meeting dealt with personnel decisions. Palmer was informed of the purpose of the special meeting by other means, and both she and her counsel attended and participated in the meeting. Members of the community appeared on behalf of Palmer and offered positive verbal and written support of Palmer's qualifications. Following the April 7 meeting, Palmer received written notice of recommendation of her termination. She requested and received an extensive hearing before the Board pursuant to W.S. 21-7-108. Adequate notice is a requisite element of administrative agency action. Here, Palmer received all the notice required by law, and could not demonstrate any prejudice or harm from the alleged inadequate notice.

SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE
We next consider whether the Board acted arbitrarily or capriciously by terminating Palmer's employment as a continuing contract teacher without sufficient facts before it to support its decision. It is well established that this court will not substitute its judgment for that of administrative agencies, including school districts, if the record establishes that the agency decision is supported by substantial evidence. Westates, 719 P.2d at 1372. The record establishes that the Board voted to terminate Palmer based on evidence of financial exigency and declining enrollment.
*1164 It is the role of an elected school board to consider all of the circumstances impinging on the efficient operation of the school district and to exercise its discretion to ensure the best possible education for students. In the spring of 1988, the Board was faced with a projected decline in revenues, coupled with overstaffing resulting from a decline in student population. This was presented to the Board together with the superintendent's RIF recommendation at the April 7, 1988 Board meeting. The recommendation to RIF Palmer (among others) was based on elimination of classes which she taught. The recommendation was presented in more detail in the form of exhibits and testimony by the superintendent of schools and the director of curriculum at the June 22, 1988 hearing. The record was supplemented at the October 3, 1988 hearing.
Palmer argues that enrollment actually increased, there were alternate methods for reorganizing the district staff, that the district had adequate financial resources, and that the board erred in its factual findings. However, the district court correctly noted that whether this decision was the "best" under the circumstances is not the test. The record contains relevant evidence that reasonably supports the Board's decision. A decline in revenues required economic choices, and realignment of classes to best meet student needs suggested retaining all mathematics teachers and reducing the number of science teachers. Consequently, we hold that the Board's decision as to Palmer is supported by substantial evidence.
There is no evidence before us that the Board acted arbitrarily or capriciously in any other respect. Palmer received a fair and complete hearing before the Board voted to terminate her employment. The Board acted under authority of W.S. 21-7-111(a)(iv) and within the letter of its RIF policy. Despite the allegation in Palmer's brief, we found no evidence in the record of a pretextual termination or retaliation. Finally, we emphasize that Wyoming statutes do not demand, and we do not impose, a requirement that school boards realign teaching duties premised on seniority. Cf. Strand v. Special School District, 392 N.W.2d 881, 886 (Minn. 1986).
We find that the Board did not act arbitrarily or capriciously or abuse its discretion. Appellant Mardell Palmer received adequate notice of the April 7, 1988 special board meeting. Further, the Board's action was supported by substantial evidence. These findings dispose of all the issues raised by the appeal. The decision of the district court is affirmed.

<|endoftext|>Trying to put an end to a barrage of attacks by pro-Israel groups and officials, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders issued a statement making clear he did not intend to state that Israel killed more than 10,000 Palestinian civilians during the 2014 Gaza war.

“The idea that Sen. Sanders stated definitely that 10,000 Palestinians were killed is just not accurate and a distortion of that discussion,” Sanders’ spokesman Michael Briggs said in a statement. “Bringing peace between Israel and the Palestinians will not be easy. It would help if candidates’ positions on this issue are not distorted.”

The clarification followed a phone conversation between Sanders and Jonathan Greenblatt, national director of the Anti-Defamation League who had publically urged Sanders to correct his comment. “The senator assured me that he did not mean his remarks to be a definitive statement and that he would make every effort to set the record straight, Greenblatt said in a statement, adding: “We appreciate his responsiveness on this issue, especially at a time when there are many false and incendiary reports blaming Israel for applying disproportionate force in its struggle for self-defense.”

Israeli elected officials were less generous with Sanders after hearing of his factually incorrect comment regarding the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza. Zeev Elkin, who serves as minister of immigration absorption in the Israeli cabinet called Sanders’ comments “weird and loony.” Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington and is now a member of Knesset in Netanyahu’s coalition said Sanders should apologize for what Oren described as a “blood libel.”

While Sanders, in his statement, sought to explain his inaccuracy when talking about the number of Palestinians killed by Israelis, he stopped short of apologizing for the mistake.

The explanation of Sanders’ inflated estimate of the Palestinian death toll provided by Briggs was that the senator’s recollection “was about the total number of casualties, not the death toll.”

According to the United Nations, 2,104 Palestinians were killed in the Gaza war, most of them civilians, and another 10,000 were wounded. Briggs noted that once Sanders was made aware by his interviewer that his estimate was mistaken, he “immediately accepted that correction and the discussion moved on to other topics.”

Sander’s interview with the New York Daily News editorial board, which has been described as “close to a disaster” exposed the Vermont senator’s lack of detailed plans for implementing his campaign promises on many key issues. It also irked pro-Israel activists who not only took issue with Sander’s misrepresentation of the Gaza death toll but also of his claim that Israel’s use of force was disproportionate and that all Israeli settlements in the West Bank should be removed as part of an Israeli – Palestinian peace deal.

Sanders, in his statement, reached back again to his past as a volunteer on an Israeli kibbutz in the 1960s to establish his pro-Israel credentials. “Sen. Sanders, as a young man, spent months in Israel and, in fact, has family living there now,” the campaign statement read. “There is no candidate for president who will be a stronger supporter of Israel’s right to exist in freedom, peace and security.”<|endoftext|>This project is part of a long-standing collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Ettore Appella (LCB/NCI), in which the Wip1 protein was discovered. Initial characterization resulted in determining two classes of phosphorylated substrates, involving many proteins involved in cell growth regulation. The first has a diphosphorylated sequence motif (pT-X-pY), such as in p38 MAP Kinase, while the second has a mono-phosphorylated sequence motif (p(S/T)Q), such as in the p53, Chk1/2 and ATM proteins. By development of an atomic-scale computer model of the extended active site of Wip1 and a series of mutagenesis experiments, we were able to reveal the structural basis for the range of substrate specificity. This lead to the development of a cyclic peptide molecule that competitively inhibits Wip1, the first inhibitor of any kind for this family of enzymes. We then pursued development of a more drug-like, small molecule inhibitor in collaboration with Dr. Daniel Appella (LBC/NIDDK), who specializes in synthetic chemistry. The resultant small molecule is based on a pyrrole ring scaffold, with 5 different emanating sidechains to mimic the amino acids of the cyclic peptide. While successful, the final inhibition constant was still only in the low micromolar range. To further this effort, we returned to optimizing the cyclic peptide inhibitor. By multiple iterations of design and testing, we were able to drastically increase the binding affinity, resulting in an inhibition constant of 110 nM. The structural modeling involved in this process revealed both important new interactions in the extended active site, and the role of the proximal B-loop in binding substrate and regulating activity. Since the B-loop is unique to the Wip1 member of the PP2C family, its role was previously unknown. We are now applying these lessons to designing a new generation of pyrrole-based inhibitors. We are also pursuing generating sufficient Wip1 protein to determine the structure by X-ray crystallography, which will greatly aid in inhibitor optimization. Recently, we have verified the requirement of binding a 3rd magnesium ion for activity of Wip1 and the related PP2Ca homologue, and used deuterium exchange mass spectroscopy to study the functional conformational changes. We are currently determining the crystal and NMR structures of PP2Ca/cyclic peptide inhibitor complexes. Recently we used Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectroscopy to study the functional structural changes of Wip1 and the PP2Ca homologue. We have also determine the crystal structure of PP2Ca with a bound substrate.<|endoftext|>Rhee Dae-eun scattered eight hits over seven scoreless innings, Takashi Ogino and Luis Cruz drove in five runs between them, and the Chiba Lotte Marines beat the Fukuoka Softbank Hawks in a 9-0 whitewash on Saturday afternoon.
