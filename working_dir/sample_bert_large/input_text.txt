Cloacal exstrophy: a case report and literature review.
Cloacal exstrophy is an extremely rare congenital malformation resulting in an exstrophy of the urinary, intestinal, and genital organs and associated with anomalies of other organ systems. We present a complicated case of cloacal exstrophy and the recent progress in the management of this probably most complicated anomaly in pediatric urology and surgery.[SEP][CLS]The EBS Stanley Clarke signature wah/tone filter pedal is more than just a wah pedal. It can be used as a tone filter AND as a volume pedal too!

The EBS Stanley Clarke signature wah/tone filter pedal is more than a standard wah pedal. In fact, the main idea behind it was to simply use it as a tone filter to be able to re-create the sound of Stanley Clarke with a standard passive bass. AND it can be used a volume pedal too!

Use as tone filter. Stanley Clarke's signature tone can be achieved with this signature pedal and a passive standard bass for a lot less than it would cost to purchase an active electronics high-end boutique instrument. Rise to the levels and spectrum of tone that until now was solely instilled in those high-end bass guitars. The pedal pad is a releaseably secure mechanism that can be adjusted to maintain its position once you to find a desired tone within the pedals frequency sweep. It is also utilized with upright basses not limited to electric basses!

As a Wah pedal. The Stanley Clarke Signature Wah is highly flexible as a wah-wah pedal. It does not affect the entire frequency range, like many other wah pedals do, which helps preserve the bottom of your sound while using the effect. The pedal feature four different preshape pass modes, Low-pass, High-pass, Band-pass and Boosted Band-pass. In addition, it offers controls to adjust the Range and Width of the effect span.

As a volume pedal. The pedal has a switch on the side that desides what happens when you switch off the wah effect. One setting simply bypass the effect, but the other turn the Wah pedal into a Volume pedal when the wah effect is switched off. There's also an Active/Passive switch on the side, in case you use the pedal with an instrument with active electronics.[SEP][CLS]If It's mainly hills and lots of snow

Among these compounds is metribuzin, 3-methylthio-4-amino-6-t-butyl-1,2,4-triazine-5-one. These compounds, however, even with their relatively low water solubility, are subject to leaching in the soil and run-off during rainstorms. The N-methylol derivatives of these compounds, which regenerate the parent compounds slowly upon exposure to water, are less soluble. These derivatives provide a slow or controlled release version of the herbicidal compounds themselves. They are, therefore, useful forms of the herbicide in that they resist leaching and run-off and, among other benefits, provide greater residual activity.
The preparation of aldehyde derivatives is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,671,523, and the preparation in particular of N-methylol metribuzin is disclosed in "Symposium on Controlled Release of Bioactive Materials, III", pages 7-11, A. B. Peppermen, Jr. and K. E. Savage (1979). The methods disclosed in the references involve the use of organic solvents, which are inflammable and relatively expensive. These methods also present economic disadvantages based on the need to recover and recycle the solvent in a commercial process. Other methods of N-methylolation of amino compounds with aqueous formaldehyde require complete dissolution of the compounds. This also can lead to an economic penalty because of large volumes that must be handled in the manufacturing operation.[SEP][CLS](CNN) We might never know exactly what they discussed -- nor can either side now seem to agree -- but President Donald Trump emerged fresh with optimism on Friday after a first face-to-face meeting with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

Speaking to reporters after the sit-down, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson remarked on Trump's and Putin's easy comfort.

"The two leaders, I would say, connected very quickly," he said. "There was a very clear positive chemistry between the two."

Tillerson, who knows Putin well from his time dealing with Moscow as the CEO of oil giant ExxonMobil, added that the conversation didn't include much "relitigating of the past."

The early and etiological diagnosis of dementia syndrome in the clinical practice remains the neuropsychological assessment through the study of the cognitive profile of the patient and the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the functions, both impaired and preserved. In this article, we describe a neuropsychological battery of cognitive evaluation to detect mild cognitive impairment in any of its clinical forms and dementia; as well as discriminate between the main profiles of dementia syndrome, based on its topographic and etiological classification (frontotemporal, temporoparietal, subcortical, cortico-subcortical and multifocal). This battery is implemented in the neuropsychological assessment specialized surgery from Navarra Hospital Center Neurology Service. Not only the tests that form the assessment protocol are presented, but also the theoretical models that are considered more appropriate for their interpretation.[SEP][CLS]Prop A Deck

The Fairsearch initiative claims that "distribution of Android at below-cost" could constitute anti-competitive behaviour or predatory pricing. Mirko Böhm produced a response (PDF) for the KDE Community.

In part, the Fairsearch complaint is an attempt to reduce the strong competition of Free Software platforms with proprietary offerings. KDE and other free software projects would be adversely affected by a misinformed decision about Android. The Internet itself (a basis for the Fairsearch complaint) is largely a product of Free Software. The KDE Community in one of the largest Free Software communities in the world, a global collaboration of companies and individuals building a free platform and creating programs in an openly governed development process.

The predatory pricing claims against Free Software platforms in the complaint to the European Commission are wrong in substance and hurtful to collaborative development and open innovation. Volunteer-driven Free Software communities rely on regulators to protect open innovation against the vested interests of strong proprietary players.

Members of the KDE Community encourage the European Commission to understand that Free Software truly fosters innovation and increases competition. At stake is the liberty of our contributors and those of other communities to collaboratively create and distribute software as a common good.[SEP][CLS]Boltzmann relation

In a plasma, the Boltzmann relation describes the number density of an isothermal charged particle fluid when the thermal and the electrostatic forces acting on the fluid have reached equilibrium.

In many situations, the electron density of a plasma is assumed to behave according to the Boltzmann relation, due to their small mass and high mobility.

Equation

If the local electrostatic potentials at two nearby locations are φ1 and φ2, the Boltzmann relation for the electrons takes the form:

where ne is the electron number density, Te the temperature of the plasma, and kB is Boltzmann constant.

Derivation

A simple derivation of the Boltzmann relation for the electrons can be obtained using the momentum fluid equation of the two-fluid model of plasma physics in absence of a magnetic field. When the electrons reach dynamic equilibrium, the inertial and the collisional terms of the momentum equations are zero, and the only terms left in the equation are the pressure and electric terms. For an isothermal fluid, the pressure force takes the form 

while the electric term is 
. 
Integration leads to the expression given above.

In many problems of plasma physics, it is not useful to calculate the electric potential on the basis of the Poisson equation because the electron and ion densities are not known a priori, and if they were, because of quasineutrality the net charge density is the small difference of two large quantities, the electron and ion charge densities. If the electron density is known and the assumptions hold sufficiently well, the electric potential can be calculated simply from the Boltzmann relation.

Inaccurate situations

Discrepancies with the Boltzmann relation can occur, for example, when oscillations occur so fast that the electrons cannot find a new equilibrium (see e.g. plasma oscillations) or when the electrons are prevented from moving by a magnetic field (see e.g. lower hybrid oscillations).

The emergence of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of 2D materials has opened new avenues for fundamental scientific research and technological applications. However, the current concepts and strategies of material engineering lack feasibilities to comprehensively regulate the as-obtained extrinsic physicochemical characters together with intrinsic properties and activities for optimal performances. A 3D mesoporous vdW heterostructure of graphene and nitrogen-doped MoS2 via a two-step sequential chemical vapor deposition method is constructed. Such strategy is demonstrated to offer an all-round engineering of 2D materials including the morphology, edge, defect, interface, and electronic structure, thereby leading to robustly modified properties and greatly enhanced electrochemical activities. The hydrogen evolution is substantially accelerated on MoS2 , while the oxygen reduction and evolution are significantly improved on graphene. This work provides a powerful overall engineering strategy of 2D materials for electrocatalysis, which is also enlightening for other nanomaterials and energy-related applications.
[SEP][CLS]Standardization: a progress report.
The introduction of nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT) assays for the detection of viral contamination of blood and blood products requires the availability of well-characterized reference reagents. Working reagents for hepatitis C virus RNA, hepatitis B virus DNA, HIV-1 RNA and human parvovirus B19 DNA have been established at NIBSC and at many other laboratories (both official medicinal control laboratories and commercial laboratories). However, as these reagents have been characterised independently, it is difficult to compare results from assays using different working reagents. Recently, a WHO International Standard was established for HCV RNA NAT assays. This standard has been calibrated in International Units (IU) and provides a common standard against which all working reagents can be calibrated. Collaborative studies to characterise two further candidate International Standards for HBV DNA and HIV-1 RNA NAT assays have been completed.[SEP][CLS]Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday signed controversial legislation limiting the amount of full-contact practices for teenage football players in an effort to reduce concussions and other serious brain injuries.

The measure prohibits football teams at public middle and high schools from holding full-contact practices during the off-season and bars them from conducting more than two full-contact practices per week, of 90 minutes each, during the season.

The bill also requires an athlete who has sustained a head injury or concussion to complete a supervised return-to-play protocol of at least seven days, according to Assemblyman Ken Cooley (D-Rancho Cordova), who introduced the bill.

“AB 2127’s practice guidelines will reassure parents that their kids can learn football safely through three hours of full-contact practice … to maximize conditioning and skill development while minimizing concussion risk,” Cooley said.


Nearly 4 million high school students nationwide suffer head injuries every year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The measure is supported by the American Academy of Neurology, the Brain Injury Assn. of California and the California Interscholastic Federation.

However, some high school coaches say the new law will interfere with their ability to field a quality team that is properly prepared to avoid injury. Many teams decide who will play in regular games by holding pre-season, full-contact scrimmages.

General anesthesia, applied under emergency conditions in both geriatric patients and patients presenting considerable in severity concomitant diseases (pulmonary and cardiovascular), is associated with serious risks in terms of restoring adequate consciousness, effective spontaneous respiration and pulmonary drainage, not infrequently requiring continuous mechanical ventilation of the patients. A procedure alternative to general anesthesia in abdominal surgery is described, consisting in the application of continuous thoracic epidural anesthesia (CTEDA), reaching i.v. thoracic segment, providing for analgesia of the whole abdomen and myorelaxation promoting accomplishment of the operative intervention against the background of preserved consciousness and spontaneous respiration. This is a report on 70 patients operated under CTEDA in the clinic of emergency surgery, University Hospital "Queen Giovanna"--Sofia, in the period June 1994 through April 1998. The methodology, superiorities and general organic effects of this particular type of anesthesia are comprehensively discussed. Emphasis is laid on the important role played by CTEDA in postoperative analgesia of patients in intensive care units, and on the contribution of the method to exclude any opiates, till recently considered as the most effective for pain relief in the post-operative period.[SEP][CLS]Endogenous retroviruses in systemic response to stress signals.
Infection of germline cells with retroviruses initiates permanent proviral colonization of the germline genome. The germline-integrated proviruses, called endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), are inherited to offspring in a Mendelian order and belong to the transposable element family. Endogenous retroviruses and other long terminal repeat retroelements constitute ~8% and ~10% of the human and mouse genomes, respectively. It is likely that each individual has a distinct genomic ERV profile. Recent studies have revealed that a substantial fraction of ERVs retains the coding potentials necessary for virion assembly and replication. There are several layers of potential mechanisms controlling ERV expression: intracellular transcription environment (e.g., transcription factor pool, splicing machinery, hormones), epigenetic status of the genome (e.g., proviral methylation, histone acetylation), profile of transcription regulatory elements on each ERV's promoter, and a range of stress signals (e.g., injury, infection, environment). Endogenous retroviruses may exert pathophysiologic effects by infection followed by random reintegration into the genome, by their gene products (e.g., envelope, superantigen), and by altering the expression of neighboring genes. Several studies have provided evidence that ERVs are associated with a range of pathogenic processes involving multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, breast cancer, and the response to burn injury. For instance, the proinflammatory properties of the human ERV-W envelope protein play a central role in demyelination of oligodendrocytes. As reviewed in this article, recent advances in ERV biology and mammalian genomics suggest that ERVs may have a profound influence on various pathogenic processes including the response to injury and infection. Understanding the roles of ERVs in the pathogenesis of injury and infection will broaden insights into the underlying mechanisms of systemic immune disorder and organ failure in these patients.[SEP][CLS]Comparative evaluation of three supplements for Helicobacter pylori growth in liquid culture.
Helicobacter pylori, a microaerophilic fastidious bacterium, has been cultured on various plating and broth media since its discovery. Although the agar media can be sufficient for the identification, typing, and antibiotic resistance studies, no secretory antigen of H. pylori can be evaluated in such media. Thus, satisfactory growth of H. pylori in liquid culture which is needed for analysis of secretory proteins without the presence of interfering agents is in demand. We assessed the impact of beta-cyclodextrin, Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), and charcoal as supplements for H. pylori growth. Furthermore, we aimed to identify the most favorable supplement that supports the secretion of the dominant secretory protein, vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA). Five clinical strains were cultured on broth media and the growth, viability, morphology, and protein content of each strain were determined. Our results revealed that beta-cyclodextrin supports the growth rate, viability, and cell lysate protein content to the extent similar to FBS. Application of beta-cyclodextrin is found to postpone spiral to coccoid conversion up to 72 h of incubation. Although FBS supports a higher VacA protein content, presence of interfering macromolecules in FBS questions its utility particularly for purposes of studying extra cellular proteins such as VacA. This study recommends further application of beta-cyclodextrin as a culture supplement with the potential capacity in neutralizing toxic compounds and flourishing the secretion of H. pylori proteins without addition of interfering proteins.[SEP][CLS]Effects of nicotinamide coenzymes on the stability of enzyme activities and proteins in niacin-deficient quail tissues against trypsin treatment.
The stability of liver and muscle enzymes and proteins in niacin-deficient quail towards trypsin treatment in the presence and absence of coenzymes, NAD or NADP, was characterized. The protection of liver dehydrogenases by coenzymes was low when they are subjected to trypsin digestion for 60 min. In contrast, in the muscle there was substantial protection against trypsin inactivation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase by NAD and of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase by NADP. Among all enzymes tested, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase showed the greatest protection against trypsin inactivation by NAD. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that muscle proteins from the niacin-deficient group were more substantially protected compared to control and pair-fed groups when liver and muscle extracts were spiked with NAD and subjected to trypsin digestion. Overall results suggest that niacin deficiency exerted specific destabilizing effects on the stability of enzymes and proteins in muscle.[SEP][CLS]

Gulalai, who has levelled allegations of harassment and corruption against Imran Khan, was attacked outside her hotel in the city, reports GEO TV.

She was in the city to attend an event organised by the Suba Bahawalpur Bahali Tehreek (SBBT).

Gulalai said that those PTI activists shouting slogans at her were not at fault and described the protesting activists as her sisters.

She quit the PTI in August 2017 after blaming Imran Khan for sending her inappropriate text messages in October 2013.

She also said that the PTI has failed to guarantee respect and dignity to women and refused to resign from National Assembly seat. She is the first female MNA from the FATA.

She joined Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in 2012 and was till last year a nominated member of the PTI Central Committee. In February this year, Gulalai launched her own party -- the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Gulalai).

Marie-Joseph-Denis Farcot (1798 – 1875) was a French engineer, inventor and manufacturer, working mainly with steam engines. 
His son, Joseph Farcot, was also a noted inventor.

Early years

Marie-Joseph-Denis Farcot was born in 1798. His father was Joseph Jean Chrysostome Farcot, a former teacher at the college of Juilly, Seine-et-Marne.
He was orphaned at a young age, and became an apprentice with Achille Colas and with Jecker, an expert maker of precision instruments. In 1820 he began work in the studio of Chaillot, where he learned steam engine construction. His training led him to create steam engines that were also precise instruments.

Manufacturer and inventor

In 1823 Farcot established a workshop on the rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève. In 1829 he received a bronze medal for two inventions, a variable-speed pump and a pump with two pistons in one body, giving a continuous jet. In 1834 he was awarded a silver medal for an olive oil press.
In 1836 Marie-Joseph Farcot patented the first method of steam distribution that gave almost complete variability to the regulator.
In 1839 he had transferred his workshop to the rue Moreau, and that year received another silver medal for an innovative steam engine with variable power.

In 1846 he transferred his metallurgical factory to Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis, where he purchased land covering . 
The factory was accessible by railway branches from the north and the west. It mainly produced steam engines, but also made boilers, pumps and other products. 
The factory employed 145 workers in 1849, and 500 to 700 between 1872 and 1902.
Marie-Joseph Farcot worked with his son, Jean Joseph Léon Farcot, who obtained many patents for mechanical engineering inventions, notably the servomechanism.
Their company was called Farcot and Son.

In 1854 Marie-Joseph Farcot was awarded patents for two ways to modify Watt's governor so as to eliminate offset.
In 1857 Marie-Joseph Farcot  proposed a number of improvements to steam hammer design, including an arrangement so the steam acted from above, increasing the striking force, improved valve arrangements and the use of springs and material to absorb the shock and prevent breakage.
He and his son Jean Joseph obtained another governor patent in 1862, and in 1864 a patent for a spring-loaded governor.

Touch screens, in particular, are becoming increasingly popular because of their ease and versatility of operation as well as their declining price. Touch screens can include a touch sensor panel, which can be a clear panel with a touch-sensitive surface, and a display device such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) that can be positioned partially or fully behind the panel so that the touch-sensitive surface can cover at least a portion of the viewable area of the display device. Touch screens generally allow a user to perform various functions by touching (e.g., physical contact or near-field proximity) the touch sensor panel using a finger, stylus or other object at a location often dictated by a user interface (UI) being displayed by the display device. In general, touch screens can recognize a touch event and the position of the touch event on the touch sensor panel, and the computing system can then interpret the touch event in accordance with the display appearing at the time of the touch event, and thereafter can perform one or more actions based on the touch event.
Mutual capacitance touch sensor panels can be formed from a matrix of drive and sense lines of a substantially transparent conductive material such as Indium Tin Oxide (ITO). The lines are often arranged orthogonally on a substantially transparent substrate. Mutual capacitance touch sensor panels not only have the ability to detect touch events on the touch sensor panels, but also have the ability to detect proximity events, in which an object is not touching the panel but is in close proximity to the panel. However, mutual capacitance touch pads are constrained in their ability to sense proximity events, and thus only provide proximity detection over a limited range of distances from the touch sensor panel.[SEP][CLS]2 years ago admin
Comments Off on US Equestrian Seeking Bids for 2018 & 2019 National Dressage Championships

LEXINGTON, Kentucky, Oct. 19, 2017–US Equestrian began seeking bids Thursday for the 2018 and 2019 dressage national championships that in recent years have staged division titles in different cities.

The federation announced it was accepting bids for championships at Grand Prix, Intermediate I, Brentina Cup under-25, junior and young rider, pony and children, young and developing horse and the dressage seat medal finals.

Deadline for completed applications is Nov. 13.

US Equestrian said organizers could bid for individual years or both years.

Interested organizers should contact Hallye Griffin, Managing Director of Dressage at hgriffin@usef.org for bid applications or more information.

In recent years, Grand Prix, Int.

Since hexachlorobenzene (HCB) action seems to be mediated through its metabolites, this study aimed to identify the metabolites and account for the HCB action by evaluating the ability of several of them to inhibit normal rat-liver porphyrinogen carboxy-lyase in vitro and to produce porphyrin accumulation in chick-embryo liver in ovo. Only three of the 11 metabolites assayed produced significant inhibitory effects at 10(-3) M concentration, the order being tetrachlorohydroquinone greater than pentachlorophenol much greater than pentachlorothiophenol. At concentrations below 10(-4) M tetrachlorohydroquinone did not inhibit the enzyme. Most of the metabolites assayed produced porphyrin accumulation, in the following order of strength: chlorophenols greater than chlorothiophenols greater than chlorobenzenes. Phenolic metabolites, therefore, not only produce the greatest amounts of porphyrin accumulation in the liver of the chick embryo but are also the strongest of the metabolite inhibitors of porphyrinogen carboxy-lyase in rat liver. It is possible that they decrease enzymatic activity by binding to the enzyme. This paper discusses the implications of these results for the mechanism of HCB porphyria induction.[SEP][CLS]Boulder wall

The actual story does not say that Loki stole the hammer from Thor.

Then when they were far from Jötunheim Thor missed Miölnir, missed the hammer that was the defence of Asgard and the help of the Gods. He could not remember how or where he had mislaid it. Loki's thoughts went toward Thrym, that stupid Giant who yet had cunning streaks in him. Thor, who had lost the hammer that he had sworn never to let out of his sight, did not know what to do. But Loki thought it would be worth while to see if Thrym knew anything about it. He went first to Asgard. The Children of Odin

By having a discussion with Thrym, the hammer's location is identified:

Dinosaurs Are Not Dead

The fawn-breasted brilliant hummingbird is one of the more common feathered dinosaurs in this part of the cloud forest of Ecuador. The female (pictured) is distinguished from the male by the absence of a throat patch, or the absence of a darker patch of feathers under the beak ("Heliodoxa rubinoides", family Trochilidae).[SEP][CLS]Am I the only one around here Who doesn't give my joint to small animal creatures?

266 shares[SEP][CLS]Job Searching Again

The past couple of weeks have kept me busy. I’ve been driving all over the county putting in applications and resumes at all sorts of tech companies. I feel a sense of urgency to get settled in someplace new since I don’t have much cash saved up. My loot is running out fast. I’ve been making lots of phone calls every day to electronics and manufacturing companies to find out as much as I can in the shortest possible time about what they do and if they’re looking for people. A few places have already called me in for interviews, which is good. Things are starting to gain momentum. Each place I’ve interviewed at so far has been interesting because I seem to know in the first five minutes whether or not they’re serious about me. I don’t know what it is that gives things away between interviewer and peasant but when I feel like they don’t really give a shit that I’m there I can tell. Then I don’t put much effort into the rest of the conversation. The reverse is true too. Sometimes after I find out what they work on I’m not interested in them at all even if they want to give me a job. Job is a job though and I might end up making a comprimise again just so I can pay my bills and eat. Besides, even the worst tech company would more than likely be better than flipping burgers in some fast food joint or being in the Army hunting for land mines. Gotta keep it all in perspective.

One of the places that has called me back for an interview has spiked my curiocity. They mostly do micro electronics work but they’ve been delibrately vague about specifics on their products or who their customers are. It’s all a big mystery. They said they would tell me some more once I come in for the interview. From the phone conversations with their Human Resources department it seems they are in a bind for people with experience. That’s exactly what I wanted to hear. So I’ll be heading over to check this company out in a couple of days and hopefully be able to worm my way into a job.[SEP][CLS]Cluster Publications

Cluster Publications is a non-profit publishing enterprise of the Pietermaritzburg Cluster of Theological Institutions (South Africa). The Cluster, founded in 1990, is an ecumenical partnership of the Evangelical Seminary of Southern Africa, the School of Religion and Theology of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, and St Joseph’s Theological Institute. (A founding member of the Cluster, the Federal Theological Seminary of South Africa, closed in 1992.)

History
As soon as the Cluster began, plans were laid for a publications house. Cluster Publications took shape under the leadership of Professor Jim Cochrane, Bernard Connor OP and Professor Gerald West in order to provide contextual theological books at affordable prices for South African scholars and students and their colleagues throughout Africa.

The first years of Cluster Publications coincided with the last days of apartheid and some of the publications reflected that concern. It also published one of the very first African books of feminist theology, Women Hold up Half the Sky in 1991.

Since 1994, the most important themes of South African life have been reflected in its publication list: contextual biblical hermeneutics, gender issues, HIV and AIDS, oral history, philosophical and ethical issues, significant figures in South African church history, and socio-political issues. Cluster Publications collaborates with the Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians and has published eight Circle books.

In 2008 it launched two new series of books. “Signs of the Times” will focus on the church’s response to important issues such as climate change and same-sex marriage. “Early Christian Voices in Africa” will publish primary source materials.

Its authors and editors reflect a wide spectrum of important voices in contextual theology: Stuart Bate, Jim Cochrane, Steve de Gruchy, Philippe Denis, Jonathan Draper Musa W Dube, Beverley Haddad, Musimbi Kanyoro, Xolile Keteyi, Madipoane Masenya (ngwana’ Mphahlele), Sarojini Nadar, Nyambura J Njoroge, Klaus Nürnberger, Teresa Okure, Isabel Apawo Phiri, Susan Rakoczy, Willem Saayman, Augustine Shutte, McGlory Speckman, Gerald West and Gunther Wittenberg.

Cluster Publications is run by a committee composed of representatives of the Cluster institutions, together with a small administrative staff.

Category:1990 establishments in South Africa[SEP][CLS]On the present schedule, Secretary of State John F. Kerry will exit his current position on the same day as President Obama leaves his, Jan. 20 of 2017.

Kerry told the Globe this week he doesn’t “have a clue” what he plans to do next.

As it happens, that’s right around the time, also according to the present schedule, that the International Olympic Committee will be gearing up to decide whether Boston will host the 2024 Summer Games. Kerry, a man of the world, a sporting enthusiast, and a self-described “huge proponent” of the Boston Games, would appear a natural fit to join the late-stage lobbying to make that happen.[SEP][CLS]Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities, assistive technology and information and communication technology requirements: where do we stand on implementation?
This article presents 2013 data from a survey provided by G3ict and Disabled Peoples International (DPI). The Progress Report identifies the degree that each of the CRPD dispositions on ATs and ICTs accessibility are enacted in local laws, policies and regulations and their impacts. The initial methodology used to develop the survey involved several steps. First, a systematic review of CRPD AT and ICT technology requirements was conducted. Second, 57 variables were identified. Third, variables were grouped into three clusters representing countries': (a) legal, regulatory and programmatic commitments; (b) capacity to implement; and (c) actual implementation results. Surveys were completed by experts in a total of 74 countries. With respect to select CRPD AT and ICT dispositions, respondent countries report an: (a) average degree of compliance within their general legal and regulatory framework at 66%; (b) average 29% of the capacity to implement; and (c) average degree of implementation and impact of 42%. Implications for Rehabilitation Survey results reflect low levels of ratifying countries implementation of laws, policies or programs that promote awareness-raising and training programs about the CRPD and its AT and ICT technology requirements. Implication 1: CRPD ratifying countries need to promote disability-inclusive AT and ICT policies and programs identified as priority areas by key stakeholders Implication 2: Government leaders and key policymakers need to address gaps in capacity building such as professional training of professionals in the areas of AT and ICT accessibility and programming through disability-inclusive cooperative development practices.[SEP][CLS]Crookhorn College stands for four core principles:

Respect, Commitment, Responsibility and Achievement.

These are known collectively as our Cornerstones. These vital principles underpin every aspect of life at the College and over the years have helped transform it to a place where learning has become dynamic, exciting and focussed, and opportunities for personal development have flourished.

My clear vision is that through these Cornerstones, no child ever feels ‘lonely’ in the classroom, fearful of learning or afraid of making a mistake. As a College our ambition is for students to achieve levels of success which surpass their expectations. This is our passion and one of the main reasons why we have been described by so many people as being a College with a ‘real heart’.

We nurture creativity together with sound moral values, self-awareness with self-esteem which, coupled with our academic yet balanced curriculum, enables us to grow confident young individuals who are ready to meet the challenges and enjoy the opportunities that life presents.[SEP][CLS]Gastroparesis following bone marrow transplantation.
Patients often develop nausea, vomiting and bloating after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). These symptoms may interfere with nutrition and the ability to take oral medications. Gastroparesis is a recognized cause of these symptoms in non-transplant patients but less is known about patients who undergo BMT. Between January 1996 and March 1997, a total of 151 patients underwent BMT. Eighteen patients (12%) developed persistent symptoms suggestive of gastroparesis (persistent nausea, vomiting or bloating). Scintigraphic gastric emptying studies were performed to assess for gastroparesis. Prokinetic agents were administered at the time of study. The records on these patients were compared with those of all other patients undergoing BMT during the same time period without these symptoms. Nine patients who demonstrated delayed gastric emptying were further evaluated with esophagastroduodenoscopy and biopsy. Biopsy samples were reviewed for evidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Fourteen of 18 patients demonstrated delayed gastric emptying and most responded to prokinetic agents given at the time of study. Age, conditioning regimen, cytomegalovirus antigenemia and acute GVHD did not appear to be associated with the development of gastroparesis. Allogeneic BMT recipients were at higher risk than autologous BMT patients (26% vs 0%, P < 0.0001). of allogeneic bmt recipients, there was a nonsignificant trend of patients receiving tacrolimus to be less likely to experience gastroparesis than those receiving cyclosporine (27% vs 48%, P = 0.08). For the nine patients undergoing upper endoscopy, GVHD on gastric biopsy was an uncommon finding and was mild when present. Gastroparesis appears to be a common cause of nausea, vomiting and bloating following allogeneic BMT. This may occur less often with tacrolimus than cyclosporine because of the former agent's prokinetic properties. Patients usually respond to prokinetic drugs at the time of scintigraphy. GVHD and CMV infection do not appear to be major contributing factors.[SEP][CLS]Holding an old train transformer that still works, Harmon Andrews III loves the store that is part hardware, part hobby, but most of

Climatic and land use changes have significant consequences for the distribution of tree species, both through natural dispersal processes and following management prescriptions. Responses to these changes will be expressed most strongly in seedlings near current species range boundaries. In northern temperate forest ecosystems, where changes are already being observed, ectomycorrhizal fungi contribute significantly to successful tree establishment. We hypothesised that communities of fungal symbionts might therefore play a role in facilitating, or limiting, host seedling range expansion. To test this hypothesis, ectomycorrhizal communities of interior Douglas-fir and interior lodgepole pine seedlings were analysed in a common greenhouse environment following growth in five soils collected along an ecosystem gradient. Currently, Douglas-fir's natural distribution encompasses three of the five soils, whereas lodgepole pine's extends much further north. Host filtering was evident amongst the 29 fungal species encountered: 7 were shared, 9 exclusive to Douglas-fir and 13 exclusive to lodgepole pine. Seedlings of both host species formed symbioses with each soil fungal community, thus Douglas-fir did so even where those soils came from outside its current distribution. However, these latter communities displayed significant taxonomic and functional differences to those found within the host distribution, indicative of habitat filtering. In contrast, lodgepole pine fungal communities displayed high functional similarity across the soil gradient. Taxonomic and/or functional shifts in Douglas-fir fungal communities may prove ecologically significant during the predicted northward migration of this species; especially in combination with changes in climate and management operations, such as seed transfer across geographical regions for forestry purposes.[SEP][CLS]Gurughli

Gurughli (also known as Gurghuli)  is the titular character of an epic cycle from Central Asia. The cycle includes up to fifty segments which are still performed by the peoples of Turkistan in Tajik as well as Turkic languages.

Gurughli, whose name means "born of the grave", is the immaculately conceived child of the sister of Ahmadkhan (a Turkistan khan). She dies during pregnancy, and the child is born while the mother is already buried and survives on the milk of one of the mares from Ahmadkhan's herd, until he is found and named by shepherds. The other hero in the tales is his adopted son Ahwazkhan, child of a fairy mother.

His tales are told in all-night storytelling sessions in free verse. The background presumed known by the audience, they start without much introduction and are accompanied by music from a two-stringed lute, the dombra. Later brought into line with Islam, the stories originate from a time before Islam reached the area but became a "vehicle for the transmission of religious and moral instruction, especially targeted at the masses of nonliterate Muslims". 

The extant corpus of Gurughli poetry entails some 100,000 lines. It reached its final form in the 18th century and was first discovered by the outside world through Russian travelers in 1870. It was recorded between 1930 and 1960 and is preserved in the Tajik Academy of Sciences.

Eurofighter Typhoon Fighter-Bomber

Apparently the nations of Europe aren’t planning on going to war with each other anytime soon. If they did, they would be fighting against each other with the exact same aircraft, I guess it comes down to the pilot’s skill at that point.

The Eurofighter Typhoon, or Europe’s answer to the 5th Generation fighter aircraft concept, is finally emerging on the world stage as a prominent export fighter aircraft. While people consistently try to compare this jet with the F-22 Raptor, it really doesn’t compete in many areas. The Eurofighter Typhoon’s primary attributes are its maneuvering and speed capabilites, while it falls short in the deep penetration role. There is only 1 pilot in the world who has flown both the F-22 Raptor and the Eurofighter Typhoon, and..[SEP][CLS]The present disclosure relates to a light-emitting device.
