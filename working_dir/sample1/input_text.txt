Montreal – August 21, 2014 – UFCW Quebec activists joined more than 2,000 participants in the Montreal Pride Parade to show their support for the LGBTQ community and respect for the human rights of all.

The 30th Annual Parade took place under the theme of “Our Flag, Our Fire”, where orange, one of the rainbow flag colours, was predominant. Proudly wearing orange t-shirts, members of the UFCW Quebec contingent marched past an enthusiastic crowd of nearly 240,000 spectators who had gathered along René-Lévesque Boulevard.

As is customary, participants paused for a minute of commemoration for those who have died of AIDS, and for all who are victims of homophobia and physical violence.

“As a progressive and welcoming organization, we are very proud to support our gay, lesbian, bisexual, and trans brothers and sisters in the fight for equality in their workplace and their community,” said Antonio Filato, president of the UFCW Quebec Provincial Council and president of UFCW Canada Local 500.

“Sexual orientation is a human right that must be protected inside and outside the workplace," said Anouk Collet, director of the UFCW Canada Quebec regional office. "We are proud to stand by our brothers and sisters of the LGBTQ community today and every day.”<|endoftext|>Christian Social Responsibility

Christian Social Responsibility (CSR, Kristet Samhällsansvar) was a lobby organization that was founded in the mid-1950s in Sweden. The goal of the organisation was to get Christian politicians placed high up on the voting papers of the Swedish political parties. The CSR had a grassroots network of active members over the entire nation and produced their own material. 

The chairman of the organisation was Centre Party voter Sven Danell. Lewi Pethrus, one of the founders of the Christian Democratic Party was the vice chairman. Birger Ekstedt, later to become the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, was the secretary of the organisation.

30 October 2003

ESA PR 71-2003. Since Tuesday 28 October, explosive events originating from the Sun have been bathing the Earth and its surroundings in high energy radiation.

Although 150 million kilometres away, the Sun is still capable of causing major disruption here on Earth to a range of systems that we depend on in everyday life. These include communication and navigation systems, aircraft and spacecraft operations and the distribution of electricity at high latitudes.

The activity started on Tuesday with a giant solar flare - the second biggest ever seen by SOHO, the ESA-NASA solar observatory that maintains a constant watch on the Sun, monitoring these events as they happen. A few minutes later, spacecraft circling the Earth began to detect high levels of energetic radiation, capable of blinding satellites and causing increased radiation levels down to normal aircraft cruising altitudes. About 24 hours after the solar flare was observed, an accompanying coronal mass ejection - a giant cloud of magnetised plasma - reached the Earth, causing rapid changes in the Earth's magnetic field and what is known as a geomagnetic storm. This storm caused widespread disruption to communications; both satellite-based and HF radio.

These events are truly sporadic and extremely difficult to predict. On Wednesday it appeared that radiation levels were decreasing. However, a second flare overnight has caused a further sharp increase in radiation levels. Here on Earth, the disruption continues today with a further coronal mass ejection expected to reach the Earth tomorrow in time for Halloween.

Solar eruptions of this type together with the associated increased radiation levels and electromagnetic disturbances around the Earth have real immediate and long-term economic impacts. During the last few days, space weather related problems have been detected on spacecraft operated by a range of agencies across the globe and operations teams are on alert. On Earth, telecommunication links have been disrupted and steps have been taken to safeguard aircraft, which including some changes in scheduling. Effects have also been detected in high latitude power grids and are being carefully monitored.

The increased dependency of our society on systems which are directly or indirectly influenced by solar and other events seen in space raises concerns about our ability to monitor and anticipate these events and the resulting changes collectively referred to as space weather. At the European Space Agency these issues are being handled jointly in the Electromagnetics and Space Environment Division by Dr Eamonn Daly’s group for the specifications of spacecraft protection and in the spacecraft operations teams.

In addition, Europe-wide coordination is currently being set up together with the European Union via its COST (Coordination in Science and Technology) programme and ESA’s General Studies Programme. This coordination aims to optimise our existing resources (together with our international partners) in order to develop an operational resource which will enable society to respond effectively to immediate as well as long-term changes in our space weather.<|endoftext|>Q:

<|endoftext|>Instagram's Looking to Launch a Standalone App for Online Shopping

Author

Published

Share it

That, reportedly, is what the Facebook-owned company is developing, which would enable it to maximize the potential of shopping on the visual platform, without risking the current Instagram user-experience in a significant way.

“The app - which may be called IG Shopping - would let users browse collections of goods from merchants that they follow, and purchase them directly within the app.”

The direct connection between Instagram’s main app and its proposed shopping channel is essential – as noted here, based on the information provided, Instagram Shopping would highlight items from businesses you already follow on IG, while you would also expect that brands on Instagram would be given additional options to link to their Instagram Shopping channels from their Instagram posts.

You can currently only link to your own website via your Instagram profile (and in Stories for eligible brands). For Instagram Shopping to work, you’d expect that it would look to open up a lot more cross-channel support - which could prove a significant lure for brands already working to build an Instagram following.

And an increasing number of brands are doing exactly that – with the platform now up to a billion monthly active users, there are now also more than 25 million active Instagram business profiles, and growing every day. The rapid rise of the platform has brands clamoring to utilize Stories and connect with usage trends, and the addition of more direct conversion options – which can more clearly attribute on-platform efforts to bottom line results – will no doubt be welcomed.

Interestingly, The Verge also notes that a standalone IG Shopping app could actually become a rival for Shopify:

“Over time, Facebook could introduce more tools for merchants who are building their businesses on Instagram, directly challenging e-commerce platforms like Shopify, according to a person familiar with the company’s thinking. Most online businesses need an Instagram account already, the thinking goes; many of them would surely use paid business tools if they became available.”

That opens up a lot of new potential for both Facebook and Instagram. It’s yet to be seen whether splitting the Instagram experience into separate elements is an effective strategy (Instagram has reportedly been testing a standalone app for DMs, while its recently launched app for IGTV is not performing well in isolation), but it would enable the platform to create a wholly aligned shopping experience, without the concerns of annoying its userbase with blatant promotions, and over-stuffing the main app.

That could also reflect Facebook’s learnings from Messenger. Facebook has been pushing to monetize Messenger - and its 1.3 billion users – by adding in new functionality, including bots and shopping tools to facilitate more business behavior. But that push hasn’t seen Messenger become the all-purpose tool that Facebook had envisioned, and earlier this year, former Facebook Messenger chief David Marcus admitted that the app had become ‘too cluttered’ and needed to be pared back.

Maybe that’s why Instagram’s going the separate app route – which seems like more work, it’ll take more effort to get people opening a completely different app. But maybe, by providing direct links, and promoting them in the main app, it could facilitate all new user behaviors. The precedent set by IGTV thus far doesn’t seem overly positive, but it’s still early days in the rollout.

There’s not a lot to go on at this stage – we don’t have any visuals or any dates for a possible rollout. But it’s definitely an interesting consideration. We’ll keep you updated on any progress.<|endoftext|>Networks are messy. Although they can be made to look neat and tidy by holding all the gear in rack mounted cabinets with serious cable management makeovers, they are still comprised of small islands of hardware each running its own proprietary software and firmware, often on proprietary silicon. For home users this isn’t really an issue, but for large government and business networks things get complicated and convoluted quickly. Especially in the case of internal networks used by governments that need to be as locked down as possible, changing even one switch, server, or connected device on the network is a tedious (and expensive!) process of rewriting security rules on a each and every hardware device.

Each hardware device (be it a switch, router, server, or firewall) operates as its own isolated island which requires individual configuration. Seeing the shortcomings of such a setup, researchers and startup companies like Nicira have started to develop open software control systems under a coined term of “software defined networking” (SDN). Stuart Miniman defines SDN as “a model for network control, based on the idea that network traffic flow can be made programmable at scale, thus enabling new dynamic models for traffic management.” Similar to the way virtualization can be used to host many (virtual) computers on one physical piece of hardware, these virtualized networks could allow companies to run multiple network slices off of a single physical network.

This is a level of control and programmability that is not currently possible due to network hardware vendors using proprietary software in all their devices (Cisco’s IOS for example). SDN takes the proprietary code out of the equation, and — using open software on all the routers, switches, firewalls, and other network devices — separates the data and control planes (the packets and the logic that determines what to do with those packets). The network hardware is then connected and mapped out in software, and network admins are able to manage the entire network from a software interface. They are also able to specialize their network and add new functionality by writing their own code and deploying it across the network.

One of the most important benefits of SDN is that commodity hardware can be used, instead of specialty hardware from specific manufacturers. Removing or relocating devices on the network would involve a few mouse clicks in a GUI rather than physically switching Ethernet cables and reconfiguring all the appropriate network devices. Martin Casado, CTO of Nicira (who is one of the companies developing SDN technologies) said that “we’re virtualizing away this physical fabric, and because now we have a virtual layer, you can do anything you want with it. Because of this virtualization, the network can be fashioned from any and all compatible hardware, and can be controlled, transformed, and secured from a software interface rather than from configuring each device individually.

There is talk around the web that SDN will spell the end for special network hardwar companies like Cisco as well as eliminate the jobs of network operators. While entirely possible, such an event is not going to happen overnight. Cisco is not likely to give up without a fight, and at this point it still has a chance to react and adapt to this new technology. The reduction in network operator IT positions is possible as well but this virtualization technology is going to open up its own field of study as well, which should lead to positions maintaining SDN. Especially while software defined networking is still a new technology, businesses are going to need their IT personnel.

Networking giant Cisco has recently responded to rumors of SDN killing its business by stating that some customers do not want programmable networks. Also, for those customers that do want the flexibility of SDN, it has funded and plans to acquire network startup company Insieme. Insieme is reportedly working on a line of programmable network switches that support OpenStack as the SDN abstraction layer. The CTO of Cisco has been quoted by Network World in stating “Networking is about to be reinvented and Cisco will do that reinvention of networking.”

In the end, the idea of a truly modular virtualized network that allows control from a software GUI is really cool. It is a big shift in networking to a programmable, open, and modular network controlled via software software that will make managing large scale networks much easier.

Head of the Syria’s Tomorrow movement Fouad Humeira met with Syrian National Coalition President Anas al-Abdah and his deputy Samira al-Massalama at the coalition headquarters in Istanbul late last week.

Talks during the meeting touched on the need to focus necessary attention on the group of Alawite girls kidnapped and held by military factions for about three years. Mr. Humeira said that he had previously received a promise from the Army of Islam rebel group to release eight of the prisoners as a goodwill initiative, but the issue has not been resolved because of the assassination of the group’s previous leader Zahran Alloush.

Attendees at the meeting discussed reasons behind widespread frustration within the Alawite sect towards the goals of the revolution. Humeira said: “The regime succeeded over 50 years in tying its survival in power to the interests of the sect.” He added: “It has become urgent and necessary to establish descriptions of revolutionary acts to distinguish them from criminal acts.”

For his part, coalition president Abdah said that “the revolution must win morally over the regime” and expressed the coalition’s willingness to give all necessary support to the Syria’s Tomorrow movement, which aims to repair relations between the Alawite sect and the rest of Syria’s communities as a result of the regime’s distortions.

Abdah stressed the need for wider representation of the Alawite sect in the institutions of the revolution and its official agencies, to reflect positively on the course of revolutionary work.

He said that “the coalition is in the process of developing a plan for a broad and full Syrian dialogue with the aim of bridging the current gap in the Syrian fabric, which was caused by the regime and its gangs over the last five years.”

Management of antiplatelet therapy in patients with cardiac stents who need subsequent surgery is complex. Current guidelines recommend delaying elective surgery or, if surgery is emergent, proceeding without aspirin cessation. This study assessed provider knowledge, attitudes, and practices for patients with cardiac stents needing subsequent surgery. A national survey was administered to Veterans Administration surgeons, anesthesiologists, and cardiologists. Questions examined guideline awareness and agreement, perceptions of bleeding risk and stent thrombosis, practice patterns for antiplatelet therapy management, and experience with perioperative stent thrombosis. Chi-square tests and generalized estimating equations were used to examine differences in reported practices. Among 295 respondents, guideline awareness (92%) and agreement (93%) were high but higher among cardiologists and anesthesiologists than surgeons. Guideline agreement and personal experience with stent thrombosis were also associated with reported practice patterns. In adjusted models for early surgeries, cardiologists and anesthesiologists were more likely to report continuation of dual therapy as compared with surgeons regardless of stent type (drug-eluting P = 0.03; bare metal P < 0.01). Despite successful guideline adoption, significant variations in practice patterns by provider type were found. Understanding reasons behind the variation and outcomes of various antiplatelet management strategies are important steps in optimizing care of patients with coronary stents undergoing noncardiac surgery.<|endoftext|>Blairmhor 8 year old Scotch whisky is produced from a vatting of up to 20 different single malt whiskies, the majority from the Highland and Speyside regions.
