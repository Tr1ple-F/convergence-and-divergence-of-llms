Montreal – August 21, 2014 – UFCW Quebec activists joined more than 2,000 participants in the Montreal Pride Parade to show their support for the LGBTQ community and respect for the human rights of all.

The 30th Annual Parade took place under the theme of “Our Flag, Our Fire”, where orange, one of the rainbow flag colours, was predominant. Proudly wearing orange t-shirts, members of the UFCW Quebec contingent marched past an enthusiastic crowd of nearly 240,000 spectators who had gathered along René-Lévesque Boulevard.

As is customary, participants paused for a minute of commemoration for those who have died of AIDS, and for all who are victims of homophobia and physical violence.

“As a progressive and welcoming organization, we are very proud to support our gay, lesbian, bisexual, and trans brothers and sisters in the fight for equality in their workplace and their community,” said Antonio Filato, president of the UFCW Quebec Provincial Council and president of UFCW Canada Local 500.

“Sexual orientation is a human right that must be protected inside and outside the workplace," said Anouk Collet, director of the UFCW Canada Quebec regional office. "We are proud to stand by our brothers and sisters of the LGBTQ community today and every day.”[SEP][CLS]Christian Social Responsibility

Christian Social Responsibility (CSR, Kristet Samhällsansvar) was a lobby organization that was founded in the mid-1950s in Sweden. The goal of the organisation was to get Christian politicians placed high up on the voting papers of the Swedish political parties. The CSR had a grassroots network of active members over the entire nation and produced their own material. 

The chairman of the organisation was Centre Party voter Sven Danell. Lewi Pethrus, one of the founders of the Christian Democratic Party was the vice chairman. Birger Ekstedt, later to become the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, was the secretary of the organisation.

Head of the Syria’s Tomorrow movement Fouad Humeira met with Syrian National Coalition President Anas al-Abdah and his deputy Samira al-Massalama at the coalition headquarters in Istanbul late last week.

Talks during the meeting touched on the need to focus necessary attention on the group of Alawite girls kidnapped and held by military factions for about three years. Mr. Humeira said that he had previously received a promise from the Army of Islam rebel group to release eight of the prisoners as a goodwill initiative, but the issue has not been resolved because of the assassination of the group’s previous leader Zahran Alloush.

Attendees at the meeting discussed reasons behind widespread frustration within the Alawite sect towards the goals of the revolution. Humeira said: “The regime succeeded over 50 years in tying its survival in power to the interests of the sect.” He added: “It has become urgent and necessary to establish descriptions of revolutionary acts to distinguish them from criminal acts.”

For his part, coalition president Abdah said that “the revolution must win morally over the regime” and expressed the coalition’s willingness to give all necessary support to the Syria’s Tomorrow movement, which aims to repair relations between the Alawite sect and the rest of Syria’s communities as a result of the regime’s distortions.

Abdah stressed the need for wider representation of the Alawite sect in the institutions of the revolution and its official agencies, to reflect positively on the course of revolutionary work.

He said that “the coalition is in the process of developing a plan for a broad and full Syrian dialogue with the aim of bridging the current gap in the Syrian fabric, which was caused by the regime and its gangs over the last five years.”

Management of antiplatelet therapy in patients with cardiac stents who need subsequent surgery is complex. Current guidelines recommend delaying elective surgery or, if surgery is emergent, proceeding without aspirin cessation. This study assessed provider knowledge, attitudes, and practices for patients with cardiac stents needing subsequent surgery. A national survey was administered to Veterans Administration surgeons, anesthesiologists, and cardiologists. Questions examined guideline awareness and agreement, perceptions of bleeding risk and stent thrombosis, practice patterns for antiplatelet therapy management, and experience with perioperative stent thrombosis. Chi-square tests and generalized estimating equations were used to examine differences in reported practices. Among 295 respondents, guideline awareness (92%) and agreement (93%) were high but higher among cardiologists and anesthesiologists than surgeons. Guideline agreement and personal experience with stent thrombosis were also associated with reported practice patterns. In adjusted models for early surgeries, cardiologists and anesthesiologists were more likely to report continuation of dual therapy as compared with surgeons regardless of stent type (drug-eluting P = 0.03; bare metal P < 0.01). Despite successful guideline adoption, significant variations in practice patterns by provider type were found. Understanding reasons behind the variation and outcomes of various antiplatelet management strategies are important steps in optimizing care of patients with coronary stents undergoing noncardiac surgery.[SEP][CLS]Blairmhor 8 year old Scotch whisky is produced from a vatting of up to 20 different single malt whiskies, the majority from the Highland and Speyside regions. All of these malts have been distilled in traditional copper stills and then matured in casks for a minimum of eight years resulting in this smooth uncomplicated Scotch that offers the perfect introduction to Blended Malt Scotch Whisky.

This blended malt has a rich, full-bodied nose and a perfect golden honey colour. It has a peat flavour on the palate with heather overtones and a touch of malted spice together with a mature sweetness in the long finish,

Altogether Blairmhor is a smooth, finely balanced, blended malt of exceptional character and reputation.[SEP]
